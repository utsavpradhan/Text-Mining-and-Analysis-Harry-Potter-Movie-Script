Dudley Dursley,Gang thug,"Oh, it's you."
Gang thug,Harry Potter,"What should we do with him, Big D?"
Harry Potter,Dudley Dursley,"Big D? Cool name, but to me, you'll always be Ikkle Duddicums."
Dudley Dursley,Harry Potter,Shut up!
Dudley Dursley,Harry Potter,"Ooo, tough guy. Not so tough in your bed, are you?"
Harry Potter,Arabella Figg,What?
Arabella Figg,Dudley Dursley,"You boys go home now, or I'll be calling your parents!"
Dudley Dursley,Harry Potter,"I heard you talking in your sleep, last night. Crying. ""No, don't kill Cedric, don't kill Cedric! Dad, help me, heeelp me! He's going to kill me! Boo-hoo!"""
Harry Potter,Dudley Dursley,"Shut up, Dudley. I'm warning you..."
Dudley Dursley,Harry Potter,Why should I?
Harry Potter,Dudley Dursley,Because if you don't I'll turn you into the idiot pig you are!
Dudley Dursley,Harry Potter,Don't point that thing at me!
Harry Potter,Dudley Dursley,"Not so brave now, are you Duddykins? Now tell your little friends to go away."
Dudley Dursley,Gang thug,G-go home!
Gang thug,Dudley Dursley,What?
Dudley Dursley,Gang thug,Get out of here!
Harry Potter,Dudley Dursley,Don't you ever speak about that again. You understand?
Dudley Dursley,Harry Potter,Don't point that thing at me!
Harry Potter,Dudley Dursley,"I said, DO YOU UNDERSTAND? !"
Dudley Dursley,Harry Potter,What's happening?
Harry Potter,Dudley Dursley,Quiet!
Harry Potter,Dudley Dursley,Dudley! Run!
Harry Potter,Dudley Dursley,Come on!
Harry Potter,Dudley Dursley,"Dudley, no!"
Voldemort,Dudley Dursley,Lumos!
Harry Potter,Voldemort,Expecto Patronum!'
Voldemort,Lily potter,"Bow to death, Harry..."
Lily potter,Harry Potter,Haaaaaaaarry!...
Harry Potter,Dementor,"""Expecto Patronum! '"
Vernon Dursley,Harry Potter,What the hell are those?
Harry Potter,Petunia Dursley,Dementors.
Petunia Dursley,Vernon Dursley,"What happened, Duddikins?"
Vernon Dursley,Harry Potter,What the hell is a dementoid?
Petunia Dursley,Harry Potter,They didn't--?
Harry Potter,Vernon Dursley,No.
Vernon Dursley,Harry Potter,I want some answers!
Harry Potter,Vernon Dursley,We were attacked.
Vernon Dursley,Harry Potter,By those...things?
Harry Potter,Vernon Dursley,"They're evil. If they get the chance, they'll suck your soul out through your mouth."
Petunia Dursley,Vernon Dursley,"They guard the wizard prizon, Azkaban"
Vernon Dursley,Harry Potter,"How do you know that? Fought 'em off, eh, Dud? Gave 'em the ol' one-two?"
Harry Potter,Vernon Dursley,You can't give a Dementor the 'ol one-two.'
Vernon Dursley,Harry Potter,Why is he all right then?
Harry Potter,Vernon Dursley,Because I used magic to save his life!
Harry Potter,Vernon Dursley,Lumos!
Vernon Dursley,Alastor Moody,Who are all you lot?
Alastor Moody,Remus Lupin,"Quiet, Dursley."
Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Harry, douse the light. We're exposed here."
Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,Nox
Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,What are you doing here?
Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"We're your advanced guard, Harry. Dumbledore just sent us as soon as he heard about the attack. We're taking you to safety. We're just waiting for the all clear."
Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,How'd he know? It just happened!
Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"You didn't think Dumbledore'd let you wander around on your own, did you? Harry, I don't believe you've met Nymphadora Tonks. Tonks, would you go get Harry's broom from the house?"
Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Harry, I don't believe you've met Nymphadora Tonks"
Remus Lupin,Nymphadora Tonks,"Tonks, would you do get Harry's broom from the house?"
Harry Potter,Alastor Moody,What's been going on? What's Lord Vol-
Alastor Moody,Harry Potter,"We're not talking about it here, it's too risky."
Alastor Moody,Nymphadora Tonks,Blast it.
Nymphadora Tonks,Alastor Moody,"Mad-eye, dear, you do realize that's disgusting?"
Alastor Moody,Nymphadora Tonks,I want 365 degree visibility on the return trip.
Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,How are we getting there?
Remus Lupin,Kingsley Shacklebolt,Brooms.
Kingsley Shacklebolt,Alastor Moody,There's the first signal.
Alastor Moody,Remus Lupin,"Right, let's go."
Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"On your broom, Harry."
Alastor Moody,Nymphadora Tonks,Form up! Form up around Harry. Make it snappy!
Alastor Moody,Nymphadora Tonks,"We'll be flying in close quarters formation. Tonks will be right in front of you, keep close to her at all times. Don't stop, and whatever you do, don't break formation. If any of us are killed, the rest of you, keep flying. If that were to happen, the survivors, fly to the east. The rear guard is standing by. They will find you."
Nymphadora Tonks,Alastor Moody,"Stop being so cheerful, Mad-eye."
Alastor Moody,Harry Potter,We must be ready. This would be the perfect moment for Voldemort to strike Harry.
Harry Potter,Kingsley Shacklebolt,"Uh, is that very likely?"
Kingsley Shacklebolt,Remus Lupin,No one's going to die.
Remus Lupin,Alastor Moody,There's the second signal!
Alastor Moody,Everybody,"Mount your brooms, Everybody. Here we go!"
Alastor Moody,Everybody,"The third signal, Everybody. Let's go!"
Alastor Moody,Everybody,Stay in formation! 
Alastor Moody,Everybody,We need more height!
Alastor Moody,Everybody,Contacts to the south!
Kingsley Shacklebolt,Alastor Moody,"Mad-eye! You, Tonks, and Lupin take Harry! We'll slow them down!"
Remus Lupin,Alastor Moody,"There's the other one, Alastor!"
Harry Potter,Dementor,Expecto--!
Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Harry, leave it to us!"
Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,No!
Remus Lupin,Dementor,"""Expecto Patronum!'"
Remus Lupin,Alastor Moody,Get Harry to the safe house!
Alastor Moody,Harry Potter,"Come on, Potter! Keep moving!"
Harry Potter,Alastor Moody,But I can help!
Alastor Moody,Kingsley Shacklebolt,"Potter, getting yourself killed won't do a thing. Now move!"
Alastor Moody,Harry Potter,"We're not far, now!"
Alastor Moody,Harry Potter,Did you get rid of them?
Kingsley Shacklebolt,Alastor Moody,"They're gone, Alastor."
Nymphadora Tonks,Alastor Moody,We're there!
Alastor Moody,Remus Lupin,Prepare for descent! Form up around Harry!
Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Stay here, Harry."
Kingsley Shacklebolt,Everybody,Clear!
Alastor Moody,Harry Potter,"Right, Harry, this way. "
Alastor Moody,Harry Potter,"Here, read this."
Alastor Moody,Harry Potter,"Come on, inside. Hurry."
Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Get in, quick, Harry. Don't touch anything."
Walburga Black,Harry Potter,"Filth! Scum! Half-breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my fathers?!"
Sirius Black,Walburga Black,"Shut up, you miserable old hag! Quiet!"
Walburga Black,Harry Potter,"Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh!"
Sirius Black,Walburga Black,"Yes, yes, do shut up!"
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,Was that your--?
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"Mother, yes. Dear old mum."
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,But...why here?
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"This house has been my family's for centuries. It's mine now. I'm the last of the Blacks. I offered it up as a headquarters for, well, and dumbledore accepted. It's about the most useful thing I've been ableto do for a long while"
Molly Weasley,Harry Potter,"Hello, Harry dear."
Harry Potter,Molly Weasley,Mrs. Weasley!
Molly Weasley,Sirius Black,"Sirius, the meeting is about to start!"
Sirius Black,Molly Weasley,Right.
Molly Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Harry, dear, go on upstairs-— quietly, if you please. They're all up there."
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Harry!
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Let him breathe, Hermione!"
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Oh, Harry! We've missed you! Are you furious with us, I bet you are!"
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Good to see you, mate."
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"Come on, inside."
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Sorry we haven't written, Harry, but Dumbledore made us promise not to."
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"We wanted to, mate, we really did, but he thought they would get intercepted. There is an awkward silence."
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Right.
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,He thought you would be safest there.
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Yeah, real safe. Attacked by Dementors, that's safe, that is."
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,He was so angry when he heard. It was...scary...
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"So, why's he keeping me in the dark?"
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Didn't you bother asking?
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"We've only seen him twice, and not for very long. He's really busy."
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,So I get to spend the summer with the Dursleys while you two are here.
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"It's not that fun, mate. Mum won't let us anywhere near the meetings."
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,You've still been here!
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,What's been going on?
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"We've already told you, we're not privyed to the meetings. But we do know a few things."
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, like Lucious Malfoy. And they're guarding something."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,What's this Order Everybody's talking about?
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,The Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore started it last time to fight You-Know-Who. He only reorganized it after last term.
Molly Weasley,Harry Potter,"You can come down now, the meeting's over."
Molly Weasley,Arthur Weasley,Arthur-
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"Well, the Ministry is furious with you."
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,Why?
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,You did magic in front of your muggle cousin.
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,You'll have to go to an disciplinary meeting tomorrow.
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,Okay.
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,I'm not really hungry. I think I'll go to bed.
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"You surprise me, Harry. I figured the first thing you'd do is start asking about Voldemort."
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,"I wanted to, but I didn't think you'd tell me anything."
Molly Weasley,Harry Potter,"And that was quite right, Harry! You're much to young--"
Sirius Black,Molly Weasley,"He has a right to know, Molly."
Molly Weasley,Sirius Black,It's not your decision!
Sirius Black,Molly Weasley,"I know what Dumbledore said, but he needs to know something."
Harry Potter,Molly Weasley,Yeah
Sirius Black,Molly Weasley,"He's not a child, Molly."
Molly Weasley,Sirius Black,He's not an adult either! He's not James.
Sirius Black,Molly Weasley,"I'm fully aware of who he is, Molly"
Molly Weasley,Sirius Black,I only have Harry's best interests at heart.
Sirius Black,Molly Weasley,He's not your son.
Molly Weasley,Sirius Black,"Who else does he have, then?"
Sirius Black,Molly Weasley,He's got me. He's like a son to me. 
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"What do you want to know, Harry?"
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,Where's Voldemort? What's he doing?
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"He's hiding for the moment, because the Ministry is ignoring his return and he doesn't want that to change."
Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"You really messed things up for him last year, Harry."
Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,How?
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,The last person You-Know-Who wanted to alert was Dumbledore.
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,And what's his plan?
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"He's building up his army again, just like before."
Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,And you're stopping him from gaining followers?
Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"We're doing our best, but it's proving to be...difficult."
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"You see, when the Ministry of Magic insists that Voldemort isn't back."
Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,But...why?
Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Fudge likes being Minister of Magic. If it turns out that Voldemort came back under his watch, he'll be sacked."
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,"But you're telling people, right?"
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"Well, they think I'm a mass- murderer, Lupin is a werewolf, Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry..."
Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,But Dumbledore is doing all he can.
Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"If he keeps it up, he might end up in Azkaban. And that would give You- Know-Who a clear field to--"
Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,What?
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,You-Know-Who wants something. Something he didn't have last time. A weapon.
Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,What kind of weapon?
Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"I'm sorry, Harry, we can't say anything more."
Molly Weasley,Harry Potter,"Morning, dear! Did you have a good sleep?"
Harry Potter,Molly Weasley,"No, my scar kept hurting."
Molly Weasley,Harry Potter,Probably just nerves…
Harry Potter,Molly Weasley,Yeah...nerves...
Molly Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Good luck, Harry!"
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"They'll have to let you off, Harry... You were defending yourself! I checked the laws."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Thanks, Hermione."
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,What does he get a hug for?
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"When you have to go to a displinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic, I'll hug you too."
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Oh, sure, that's why."
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"Ronald Wealsey, are you jealous?"
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Me? Jealous? Of course not, it just doesn't seem fair that you hug one friend more than the other, is all..."
Hermione Granger,Arthur Weasley,Would you like a hug?
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"No, I'd hate to force you.."
Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"Well, come on, Harry. Time to go."
Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,Bye.
Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"Good, good, not very many Muggles. "
Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"Well, come on Harry, in we go."
Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"I do love using the Fellytone! Now, let's see, what's the number again..."
Witch,Arthur Weasley,Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your business.
Arthur Weasley,Witch,"Harry Potter, disciplinary hearing."
Witch,Arthur Weasley,Pleas stand by.
Arthur Weasley,Witch,"Usually I Apparate, but you're too young, so I thought we'd take this scenic route."
Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"Keep close, Harry!"
Arthur Weasley,Perkins,"Ah, Perkins, good morn-"
Perkins,Arthur Weasley,"Arthur, they've changed the time of Potter's hearing."
Arthur Weasley,Perkins,Blast! Dumbledore thought they might try that.
Perkins,Arthur Weasley,It started at eight!
Arthur Weasley,Witch,"Good lord, that was five minutes ago! Come on, Harry!"
Witch,Harry Potter,Department of Mysteries.
Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,Department of Mysteries?
Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"Yep, I've got no idea what they get up to in here, it's top secret."
Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"Come on, Harry!"
Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,I've been there before...
Arthur Weasley,Cornelius Fudge,"Now, Harry, I find that highly unlikely…"
Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"There you are, Harry, in you go...good luck..."
Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,You're late.
Harry Potter,Cornelius Fudge,Er...sorry.
Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,"No matter, the accused will take his seat. "
Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,"Very well, we are ready to begin."
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"Witness for the Defence, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore."
Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,"Ah...you...er...got our message that the time had changed, did you?"
Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,"Must have missed it. However, due to a fortunate mistake, I arrived at the Ministry three hours early."
Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,Well. The...ah...charges. 
Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,"The charges against the accused shall now be read into the record: That the accused did with deliberation and fore-knowledge of the illegality of his actions, produce a patronus charm in full sight of a Muggle. You are Harry James Potter?"
Harry Potter,Cornelius Fudge,Yes.
Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,And you conjured a patronus on the night of eleventh of August?
Harry Potter,Cornelius Fudge,"Yes, but-"
Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,Within full sight of a Muggle?
Harry Potter,Cornelius Fudge,"Yes, but-"
Susan Bones,Harry Potter,"You produced a Patronus? A fully- formed Patronus, with a clearly- defined shape?"
Harry Potter,Susan Bones,Yes.
Susan Bones,Harry Potter,"That is most remarkable, Mr. Potter."
Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,It doesn't matter how impressive it was!
Harry Potter,Susan Bones,But I did it because of the Dementors!
Susan Bones,Harry Potter,What do you mean?
Harry Potter,Cornelius Fudge,"My cousin and I were attacked by Dementors. That's why I had to use the Patronus, to drive them away."
Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,"Ah, yes, yes, another cock-and-bull story."
Harry Potter,Cornelius Fudge,It's the truth
Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,Of course it is.
Susan Bones,Harry Potter,Dementors in Little Whinging?
Cornelius Fudge,Arabella Figg,"Oh, come now, Susan. He's clearly lying."
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"Actually, we have a witness to the presence of the Dementors in question."
Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,We haven't got time to-
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"I may be wrong, but I do believe that it says somewhere in the Wizagammot Charter of Rights that the Accused has the right to present witnesses to prove his or her case? In fact, I do believe I wrote that particular bit myself."
Cornelius Fudge,Percy,"Very well. Weasley, fetch the witness."
Cornelius Fudge,Arabella Figg,Full name?
Arabella Figg,Cornelius Fudge,"Arabella Doreen Figg, resident of Little Whinging."
Cornelius Fudge,Arabella Figg,So...what is your story?
Arabella Figg,Cornelius Fudge,I was sitting on my porch when I saw the two Dementors gliding towards the two boys.
Susan Bones,Arabella Figg,What did the Dementors look like?
Arabella Figg,Susan Bones,"Well, they were big and wore great, tattered cloaks."
Susan Bones,Arabella Figg,Anything else?
Arabella Figg,Cornelius Fudge,I-I felt them. It was horrible...like I would never be happy again.
Cornelius Fudge,Arabella Figg,"Very well, you may go."
Cornelius Fudge,Susan Bones,Not very convincing.
Susan Bones,Cornelius Fudge,"Oh, I disagree. She described their effects very completely."
Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,So two Dementors just happen to be in Little Whinging? I think not...
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"Only if the Dementors are still taking their orders from only the Ministry these days. I believe you know my views on this, Cornelius."
Cornelius Fudge,Dolores Umbridge,"Yes, and they're nothing but bilge, Dumbledore."
Dolores Umbridge,Cornelius Fudge,"Excuse me, Dumbledore, but did you just accused the Ministry of Magic of ordering an attack on this boy?"
Albus Dumbledore,Dolores Umbridge,"If the dementors are taking their orders from the Ministry exclusively, then it must certainly follow logically that someone in the Ministry ordered the attack. And in that case, I'm sure the Ministry will make a full inquiry"
Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,Dementors are irrelevant!
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"On the contrary, Cornelius. If they were there, then harry was acting in self-defense, which is perfectly allowable under Clause Seven of the Decree of Reasonable Restriction of Underaged Wizardry. We are all in agreement on this?"
Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,"Well, yes, if he's telling the truth!"
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"You have heard it from eye-witnesses, Cornelius"
Cornelius Fudge,Everybody,"Very well, all for clearing the accused of charges?"
Cornelius Fudge,Everybody,All opposed?
Cornelius Fudge,Everybody,Fine! Cleared of all charges!
Albus Dumbledore,Arthur Weasley,Excellent.
Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"Harry, you've been let off! That's wonderful!"
Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,You were tried by the full court?
Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,"I think so, yeah."
Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"Well, no matter. Let's go home."
Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,Er...is Percy mad at you?
Arthur Weasley,Lucius Malfoy,"Ah...yes...I'm afraid we had a bit of a row. He, well, he sided with Fudge and the rest of us sided with Dumbledore, so Percy left."
Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,"Well, well, if it isn't Patronus Potter."
Harry Potter,Lucius Malfoy,What are you doing here?
Lucius Malfoy,Cornelius Fudge,"Come now, Potter, I really don't think that private matters between the Minister and myself are any concern of yours."
Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,"All you need to concern yourself about are… your dreams, Potter."
Lucius Malfoy,Cornelius Fudge," Shall we continue this in your office, Fudge?"
Cornelius Fudge,Lucius Malfoy,Certainly.
Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,"If he wanted to talk to the Minister, why down here?"
Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"Dunno, Harry. Some things are just beyond comprehension. Settle down, you three! Sirius, we saw Fudge talking with Lucius Malfoy on Level Nine again. Tell Dumbledore, next time he comes in, would you?"
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,I knew it!
Everybody,Harry Potter,"He got off, he got off, he got off!"
Arthur Weasley,Everybody,"Settle down, you three!"
Arthur Weasley,Sirius Black,"Sirius, we saw Fudge talking with Lucius Malfoy on Level Nine again. Tell Dumbledore, next time he comes in, would you?"
Sirius Black,Arthur Weasley,"Yeah, absolutely."
Arthur Weasley,Fred Weasley,"Well, I'd better be off. I've got a bewitched vomiting toilet to deal with."
Fred Weasley,George Weasley,"George, remember that concept. Vomiting Toilet."
George Weasley,Arthur Weasley,"Right you are, Fred."
Arthur Weasley,Sirius Black,"Also, I'm covering for Tonks on guard duty later tonight, so I won't be back until late."
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,Harry!
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"You all right, Harry?"
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,Yeah...just...my scar...the pain is getting stronger.
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"Harry, I've got something that might interest you."
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,This was the original Order of the Phoenix. Found it while we were cleaning.
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"There's Mad-eye and Dumbledore, right next to Dedalus Diggle; Marlene McKinnon, she was killed two weeks after this was taken...; then there's Frank and Alice Longbottom, tortured into insanity by Death Eaters; Lupin, of course.. Ah, Edgar Bones, they only ever found bits of him; Caradoc Dearborn, he vanished six months later...; Hagrid, of course; Gideon and Fabian Prewett, it took fice Death Eaters to finish those two off; me, of course...; and there they are!"
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,My parents.
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,"I miss them, Sirius..."
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"I know, Harry, I know. I miss them too. "
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,It's not fair that I got to spend so much time with them and you didn't...
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,"Why'd they have to die, Sirius, why?"
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"I don’t' know, Harry. I wish I did, but I don't…"
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"I know I'm not your father, Harry, but I'll always be there for you, if I can help it..."
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,Thanks.
Kreacher,Sirius Black,"That mudblood with the scar, he cries, why does he cry so…?"
Sirius Black,Kreacher,"Kreacher, get out of here! Now!"
Kreacher,Harry Potter,"Oh, how the old Mistress would weep to see the traitor in her house..."
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,Who..who was that?
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"Kreacher. He's been alone with the house for years, he's gone a bit funny. You'd better get some rest."
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Harry, Ron and I, we've been named House Prefects!"
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"What about you, Harry?"
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Are you sure? I would have thought you would get one!
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,I'm sure. Nothing.
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"So...congratulations Ron, Hermione..."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Well…thanks Harry,"
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Come on, lets go back downstairs!"
Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,"Yes, do go enjoy yourselves."
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,What is that?
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,What?
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,That…that…thing!
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Harry, there's nothing there, mate…"
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Yes it is, it's right there!"
Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,"I see them too, Harry."
Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,Er...you are?
Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,Luna. Luna Lovegood.
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Well, thanks Luna."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Hagrid's cabin looks deserted.
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,I hope he's all right...
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,What if he were still on his
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,…what if he's still on his mission from Dumbledore?
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Yeah, could be."
Albus Dumbledore,Dolores Umbridge,"I beg a few moments of your attention, as I have a few start of term announcements. Right off, our caretaker, the good Mr. Filch, has reminded me for what he says is the four-hundred and sixty-second time that he had an annually updated list of various banned items, usually introduced by our humour experts Fred and George Weasley... ... which are posted in an extensive list on the door to Mr. Filch's door. Also, we have two staffing changes this year. Professor Grubby-Plank will be taking the post of Care of Magical Creatures post as Professor Hagrid is on...extended leave. Additionally, we have Professor Umbridge, who has kindly agreed to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts-—"
Dolores Umbridge,Dean Thomas,"Hem, hem, Headmaster, if I could address the school?"
Dolores Umbridge,Albus Dumbledore,"Thank you, Headmaster. Now, how are we all doing tonight? I thought I would just say a few words. I am here at the Ministry of Magic's bequest, under Educational Decree twenty-two, which states that if the Headmaster of Hogwarts is unable to fill any teaching post the Ministry shall select one for the position."
Dolores Umbridge,Dean Thomas,"The Ministry has always considered the magical education of our children to be of vital importance, and the passing down of this ancient and noble art must be given to the next generation, lest it be lost forever… ithout progress, stagnation. But progress for progress's sake is to be discouraged, for our art requires no tinkering. A balance must be attained, the new and the old, permanence and change, tradition and innovation, order and chaos. There are large changes are for the best, and to prevent the destruction of our civilization from its own decay. Thank you."
Dean Thomas,Harry Potter,"So why didn't your mum want you to come back to Hogwarts, Seamus?"
Harry Potter,Seamus Finnigan,What?
Seamus Finnigan,Harry Potter,Me mam didn't want me to come back to Hogwarts...
Harry Potter,Seamus Finnigan,Why?
Seamus Finnigan,Harry Potter,Well...because of you...
Harry Potter,Seamus Finnigan,What did I do?
Seamus Finnigan,Harry Potter,"She...well, she figure's you're, well...you're lying about You-Know- Who and Dumbledore's a right nutter…"
Harry Potter,Dolores Umbridge,Where'd she get that from? 
Harry Potter,Seamus Finnigan,So…she believes this stuff?
Seamus Finnigan,Harry Potter,Well…yeah…
Harry Potter,Seamus Finnigan,"But…but you believe me, don't you?"
Harry Potter,Hedwig,"No one believes me, Hedwig. No one…"
Harry Potter,Hedwig,I'm alone…
Harry Potter,Hedwig,"Sorry, Professor..."
Dolores Umbridge,Hermione Granger,"Hmm, let's see, five points from Gryffindor for coming in late."
Dolores Umbridge,Hermione Granger,"Now, as I was saying before Mr. Potter interrupted with his antics, your Defense Against the Dark Arts education has been rather fragmented and disjointed in your past classes, hasn't it? I will be following a pre-approved Ministry-prepared, theory-centered Defense lesson plan."
Dolores Umbridge,Hermione Granger,Copy this down.
Dolores Umbridge,Hermione Granger,Yes?
Hermione Granger,Dolores Umbridge,I wanted to know something about your course aims.
Dolores Umbridge,Hermione Granger,"Well, they should be perfectly self- evident."
Hermione Granger,Dolores Umbridge,"Well, I don't think they are. They say nothing about actually doing spells."
Dolores Umbridge,Hermione Granger,"I can imagine no circumstances in my class where you would need to use spells, my dear!"
Hermione Granger,Dolores Umbridge,But surely the whole point of Defense against the dark arts is practical application?
Dolores Umbridge,Hermione Granger,"Miss Granger, this class has been approved by Ministry experts. Are you a Ministry Expert?"
Hermione Granger,Dolores Umbridge,"No, but-"
Dolores Umbridge,Hermione Granger,"Then you have no business challenging those who are. We will be learning about spells in a safe, risk-free environment-"
Hermione Granger,Dolores Umbridge,But we've got O.W.L.s coming up! You expect us to do the spells with no practice?
Harry Potter,Dolores Umbridge,What good's theory in the real world? What about Lord Voldemort?
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,"This is school, not the real world, Mr.Potter. There is nothing out there waiting to get you."
Harry Potter,Dolores Umbridge,What about Lord Voldemort?
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,"Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter. Let me set the record straight."
Dolores Umbridge,Everybody,Some of you have been told that a certain dead wizard has returned. This is a lie.
Harry Potter,Dolores Umbridge,It-is-NOT-a-LIE!
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,"Mr. Potter, you have just landed yourself in detention!"
Harry Potter,Dolores Umbridge,"So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead? Or are you calling me a murderer?"
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,The boy's death was a tragic accident.
Harry Potter,Dolores Umbridge,It was MURDER! I saw it happen!
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,"Mr Potter, you have earned yourself a week's worth of detentions!"
Harry Potter,Dolores Umbridge,"Yeah, talk to somebody who cares. Voldemort killed Cedric, and you know it."
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,"That goes to Professor McGonagall, dear."
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,Is this true? Did you shout at Professor Umbridge?
Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,"Yeah. But she called me a liar! Yes, Professor."
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"My dear boy, do use yourr common sense! Umbridge is directly reporting to Fudge. She is here to… interfere… with Dumbledore. And things could get much worse, trust me. Use caution, always, Potter. Do not mess with Dolorus Umbridge, she is dangerous. The Order's hands are tied at Hogwarts, Harry. If you get too deep into trouble, we may not be able to get you out. Do you understand?"
Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,"Yes, Professor."
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,Good. Off you go.
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,How can Dumbledore let that horrible woman teach? And when we're taking our OWL tests too!
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,You reckon she's here to spy on us?
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"Well, not us specifically, but definitely Dumbledore and the Order."
Angelina Johnson,Harry Potter,"Well, way to go, Potter. Your detention is at the same time as Quidditch practice!"
Harry Potter,Angelina Johnson,Oh! Sorry...
Angelina Johnson,Harry Potter,"Yeah, well, you're going to have to get out of it somehow. We're holding tryouts for Keeper now Wood's gone, and I wanted to have the whole team there."
Harry Potter,Angelina Johnson,"I'll never get out of it, Angelina."
Angelina Johnson,Harry Potter,"Well, just...don't do it again!"
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Well, Harry, shall we start on Snape's report?"
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Later, I've got detention."
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Good luck, Harry."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Thanks.
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,"Ah, Potter. Sit down."
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,"You're going to be doing lines, tonight, Mr. Potter, and you'll be using this quill."
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,"You will write ""I will not tell lies"" until I tell you to stop. Understand?"
Harry Potter,Dolores Umbridge,There's no ink.
Dolores Umbridge,Hermione Granger,Oh...you won't need ink.
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,"Problem, Potter?"
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,"That's enough for this evening. Same time, tomorrow, and we'll see if we can get the message to sink in a bit deeper."
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Hey, Harry."
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Have you seen Ron? I can't find him anywhere.
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"No, I haven't."
Hermione Granger,Dolores Umbridge,He's been acting fishy all week. He's up to something.
Harry Potter,Dolores Umbridge,Uh huh.
Harry Potter,Harry Potter,"Another night, another detention."
Dolores Umbridge,Ron Weasley,"That's enough for tonight, Potter. Let's see that hand."
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Harry! I tried out for Quidditch Keeper at the tryouts! I'm on the team!
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Harry--bloody hell!
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,He's got to be taken to the hospital wing.
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,No. Can't give… Umbridge the satisfaction…
Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,Umbridge did this?
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,You said she was making you do lines!
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,She is. But the quill has some sort of spell on it. It uses blood for ink.
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,That old hag! She's sick!
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Oh, Harry. You've got  to go to Dumbledore. You can't keep this up."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"No, I'm telling anyone."
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Harry, I really think you should tell--"
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,No!
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,I don't need his help. I don't need anyone's help.
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Hagrid's still not back yet. I hope he's all right.
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,I've asked Sirius about it.
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Harry, you can't write to him! Owls are being intercepted, it isn't safe."
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Don't worry, Hermione, I wrote it in code. Anyway, I figured I need to tell someone about Umbridge. My scar hurt again last night in detention."
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Always knew she was a bit fishy.
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,You think she's working for You- Know-Who?
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Well, it's a possibility, isn't it?"
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"I suppose so. He could have her under the Imperious Curse, though it's unlikely. Dumbledore'd know."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Yeah, but Dumbledore didn't have a choice, did he? She'd been sent here by the Ministry."
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Anything about Harry?
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"No, nothing. Wait! Look at this!"
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"""Trespass at Ministry. Sturgis Podmore has appeared before the Wizengamot with charges of trespass and attempted roberry at the Ministry of Magic on the 31st of August. He was arrested when found trying to break into a top-security door at one in the morning. Podmore was convinced and sentenced to six months in Azkaban."""
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Sturgis Podmore?
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Wait, he's one of the Order!"
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Quiet!
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Do you s'pose it was a frameup?
Dean Thomas,Everybody,"Come on, we'll be late for charms if we don't hurry"
Harry Potter,Everybody,You go on without me. I want to send this.
Harry Potter,Hedwig,Hedwig!
Harry Potter,Cho Chang,Hi.
Cho Chang,Harry Potter,Oh…hi. Didn't think anyone else would be up here.
Cho Chang,Harry Potter,Have you found a new Keeper for Quiddich
Harry Potter,Cho Chang,"Yeah, my friend Ron Weasley."
Cho Chang,Harry Potter,He any good?
Harry Potter,Cho Chang,"Well, he made the team. I missed the tryouts."
Cho Chang,Harry Potter,"Yeah, Umbridge. You were really brave, standing up to her."
Harry Potter,Cho Chang,"Yeah…well, it was the truth"
Argus Filch,Harry Potter,"Right, Potter. I'll have what you're sending."
Harry Potter,Argus Filch,What?
Argus Filch,Harry Potter,I have had a tip-off that you are ordering a large quantity of Dungbombs! Now hand it over.
Harry Potter,Argus Filch,"You're too late, it's gone"
Cho Chang,Harry Potter,"Yeah, I saw him send it"
Argus Filch,Harry Potter,"I get a single whiff of a Dungbomb in this castle, Potter… and you're mine."
Cho Chang,Harry Potter,"Um, you weren't ordering dungbombs, were you?"
Harry Potter,Cho Chang,No.
Cho Chang,Harry Potter,"I wonder why he'd think you were. Well, see you, Harry."
Hermione Granger,Hermione Granger,What a load of rubbish!
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"You, ordering dungbombs. I mean, really."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Yeah, it doesn't make any sense"
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Unless whoever tipped Filch off was interested in reading your mail, Harry. I mean, doesn't it seem a littler too cincidental that Filch was tipped off when you happened to be sending a message to Sirius"
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Yeah that does seem weird. You figure its umbridge?
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,I don't know.
Lucius Malfoy,Ron Weasley,"Hey, Weasley! Nice job out on the field today! You'll be our best player on the pitch!"
Harry Potter,Lucius Malfoy,"Get bent, Malfoy"
Ron Weasley,Lucius Malfoy,"No, he's right. I'm useless out there. Complete rubbish."
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,It's your first practice. Don't worry about it.
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,I'm gonna make a fool of myself out there
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Are you all right, Harry?"
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Yeah. Its just… the pain's getting stronger.
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,I don't know how we're ever going to pass our O.W.L.s in defense against the dark arts without any practice! That Umbridge woman is so…
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,We've got to do something about her.
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Yeah, well, poison should do the trick."
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Don't be silly, Ron. Not her, I meant her teaching. We're not going to learn anything in that class."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Yeah, that's true."
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"Anyway, I thought we should do it ourselves."
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Do what?
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Defense Against the Dark Arts. We'd teach ourselves.
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,I don't know…
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Hermes?
Ron Weasley,Everybody,It's from Percy
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Read it.
Ron Weasley,Everybody,"""Dear Ron, congratualtions on becoming a Prefect. For some time I was worried you would take the 'Fred and George' route instead of following my footsteps. You can imagine my relief that this is not the case""."
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Keep reading.
Ron Weasley,Everybody,"""Given your attachment to using me as a role model, I will give you a bit of advice from one respecter of authority to another. It is likely that you have been seeing quite a lot with Harry Potter of late. I must recommend you break ties with that boy as soon as possible. He may be Dumbledore's favorite, but Dumbledore may not be in charge at Hogwarts much longer. Your loyalities should lie with the Ministry of Magic, not Dumbledore and Potter's personality cult. Please do not fear breaking ties with Potter. If trouble arrises, go to Dolores Umbridge, a truly delightful woman, I hope you will carefully consider my advice to you, Ron. Don't let the dangerous errors of Dumbledore, Potter, and unfortunately our parents lure you into destroying a perfectly good career. Percy."""
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Well, if you want to, ah, ""break ties"" with me, I swear I won't get violent."
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,He is the world's biggest git!
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,Watch it!
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,Sirius?
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,Right you are. Got you letter and though we should talk in person.
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,What was that?
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,Letter from Percy.
Ron Weasley,Sirius Black,"Yah, full of the usual rubbish."
Hermione Granger,Sirius Black,Except he did mention that Dumbledore might not be in charge here much longer.
Sirius Black,Hermione Granger,It doesn't surprise me. Fudge wants Dumbledore out.
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,Why?
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,He's worried Dumbledore is trying to turn the students against the Ministry.
Hermione Granger,Sirius Black,"Well, that would explain why Umbridge isn't teaching us anything useful in Defense against the Dark Arts."
Sirius Black,Hermione Granger,That's exactly what he's worried about. Fudge is getting more paranoid about Dumbledore every day.
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,What do you know about Umbridge?
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,She's a nasty piece of work. Apparently she hates part-humans.
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,Could she be a Death Eater?
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"The Order Seriously doubts it. She's no picnic, but she's no Eater either."
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,But she's evil.
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"The world isn't split into the Order and the Death Eaters, Harry."
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"As to your question about Hagrid, well, no one is really sure what happened to him. Actually. He was supposed to be back a while ago."
Hermione Granger,Sirius Black,What?
Sirius Black,Hermione Granger,Dumbledore's not worried about his though. Hagrid's tough. He'll be all right.
Ron Weasley,Sirius Black,But if he was supposed to be back by now…
Sirius Black,Ron Weasley,"Look, asking questions about him will only make it more obvious that he's not back."
Sirius Black,Everybody,Get out of here!
Hermione Granger,Everybody,I cannot believe it!
Ron Weasley,Everybody,"""Ministry Passes Educational Decree Number Twenty-Three: Dolores Umbridge Appointed Hogwarts High Inquistor""?"
Ron Weasley,Everybody,What's that mean?
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,It says here that the High Inquistor has the power to inspect all of the teachers.
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Your'e Kidding!
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,That's not all. The High Inquisitor also has the power to sack teachers as well.
Fred Weasley,Everybody,"So, seen the news have you?"
George Weasley,Everybody,"Personally, I envy you three."
Ron Weasley,George Weasley,Why's that?
George Weasley,Ron Weasley,Umbridge is inspecting McGonagall in your period. That old toad won't know what hit her
George Weasley,Ron Weasley,"Oh, to be a youth again, to experience the innocent glee of watching Umbridge be destroyed by the greatest Head of Gryffindor this century"
Fred Weasley,Everybody,"Well, we'll expect a full report after."
George Weasley,Everybody,Complete with facial expressions.
Sybill Trelawney,Everybody,Greetings my children. I sense even now that many of you have already made the transition into the beyond!
Sybill Trelawney,Everybody,Today we will be continuing our interpretation of prophetic dreams. Please divide into your groups and discuss your recent night time visions using the text as a guide.
Dolores Umbridge,Sybill Trelawney,And how long have you been at this post?
Sybill Trelawney,Dolores Umbridge,Near to sixteen years I have been guide to young seers possessed of the Inner sight.
Dolores Umbridge,Sybill Trelawney,I understand you are the descendent of the famous Seer Cassandra Trelawney?
Sybill Trelawney,Dolores Umbridge,I am.
Dolores Umbridge,Sybill Trelawney,And you are the first since Cassandra to have the Second Sight?
Sybill Trelawney,Dolores Umbridge,These things tend to skip...several...generations.
Dolores Umbridge,Sybill Trelawney,Of course.
Dolores Umbridge,Sybill Trelawney,"Now, if you would kindly make a prediction for me?"
Dolores Umbridge,Sybill Trelawney,The Inner Eye does not See upon command!
Sybill Trelawney,Harry Potter,"My dear boy, your dream diary, if you please!"
Sybill Trelawney,Harry Potter,My dear boy! My poor boy! These dreams are evil portends!
Harry Potter,Sybill Trelawney,"""Dreamt I was at breakfast eating oatmeal""?"
Sybill Trelawney,Harry Potter,"Yes, yes, oatmeal! Are you telling me you cannot see the signs? The foretelling of suffering and death?"
Harry Potter,Sybill Trelawney,Er...
Sybill Trelawney,Harry Potter,Perhaps you are not as in the beyond as the others.
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,"Well, if that's the best you can do, Professor, I will be going."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Where are we going, Hermione?"
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,There we are.
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"""The Hog's Head,"" Hermione?"
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Come on, I'll explain in a minute."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Hermione, what's going on?"
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,These are some people I mentioned my Defense Against the Dark Arts idea with.
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,You mean about us teaching ourselves?
Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,"Hey, Harry."
Harry Potter,Neville Longbottom,"Hey, Neville."
Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,"It's good to see that the horned snorkle-stacks haven't gotten you yet, Harry."
Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,"Uh...same to you, Luna."
Hermione Granger,Everybody,"Hi Everybody. I thought it would be good if we met and talked over how we wanted to teach ourselves Defense Against the Dark Arts. Because we need to learn it properly, not the rubbish Umbridge is doing."
Fred Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Hear, hear!"
Hermione Granger,Everybody,"Obviously, this will help us pass our O.W.L.s, but more importantly, it gives us the ability to protect ourselves from...Lord Voldemort. Several people jump or wince in fear at the name."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,That's the first time you've said his name.
Zacharias Smith,George Weasley,How do we know You-Know-Who's really back?
George Weasley,Justin Finch-Fletchley,Dumbledore believes he is.
Justin Finch-Fletchley,Hermione Granger,You mean Dumbledore believes him.
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"That's true, but I think we're drifting from the purpose--"
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"It's okay, Hermione."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,I believe Voldemort's back because I fought him last year. Dumbledore's already told the school that. If you didn't believe him you won't believe anyone.
Hermione Granger,Everybody,"Well...anyway...uh, I think that in order to learn properly we'll need a teacher."
Neville Longbottom,Hermione Granger,But we're all students. None of us has the experience to--
Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,Someone here does. Everybody looks at her. She is staring directly at Harry.
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Me?
Michael Corner,Everybody,I for one would like to know why Potter's qualified and the rest of us aren't.
Ginny Weasley,Everybody,"Well, he's only confronted You-know-Who himself four times and lived to talk about it."
Susan Bones,Harry Potter,One of the portraits said you'd killed a Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets with that sword in Dumbledore's office.
Harry Potter,Susan Bones,"Uh...well, yeah, I did."
Lee Jordan,Harry Potter,"Blimey, Harry..."
Lavander Brown,Harry Potter,Wow...
Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,Can't forget that he saved the Sorcerer's Stone from You-Know-Who in his first year.
Cho Chang,Fred Weasley,And last year he got through the Triwizard Tournament!
Ron Weasley,Cho Chang,Not to mention you dueled with You- Know-Who all alone and he still couldn't kill you!
Ginny Weasley,Hermione Granger,And you fought off those dementors that attacked you this summer.
Hermione Granger,Neville Longbottom,So all in favor of taking lessons from Harry? Where are we going to meet?
Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,What about an unused classroom?
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,That might work. I'll look into that.
Hermione Granger,Ernest Macmillan,"Ok, good. I think we should put our names down, so we know who was here."
Ernest Macmillan,Hermione Granger,"I don't know...if it were found...I mean, Umbridge wouldn't like what we're doing..."
Hermione Granger,Angelina Johnson,"Honestly, Ernie, do you think I'd just leave it lying around? Besides, its enchanted. Also, what should we call ourselves?"
Angelina Johnson,Hermione Granger,What about the Anti-Unbridhe League?
Hermione Granger,Ginny Weasley,We need something that doesn't give away what we're doing.
Ginny Weasley,Hermione Granger,I think it should be Dumbledore's Army.
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Dumbdore's Army it is, then. The D.A. for short. We'll let you know when we're going I think that went well."
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,I think that went well.
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Yeah.
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"And did you see Cho, Harry? "
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,What about her?
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Well, she couldn’t keep her eyes off you, could she?!"
Angelina Johnson,Harry Potter,"Harry, you won't believe...that Umbridge woman...this is too much!!"
Harry Potter,Angelina Johnson,What's she done now?
Angelina Johnson,Harry Potter,Follow me.
Harry Potter,Angelina Johnson,"""By order of the Hogwarts High Inquisitor: All student organizations, societies, teams, groups, and clubs are henceforth disbanded. Permission to reform must be approved by High Inquisitor Umbridge. No student organization can exist without the knowledge and approval of the High Inquisitor. Any student found to be a part of an illegal organization will be expelled immediately."""
Angelina Johnson,Harry Potter,She refused to allow us to reform the Gryffindor team. We had to go to Dumbledore to get her to allow it.
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Not only that, but what about the D.A.? This isn't a coincidence. She knows."
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,She can't!
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Look, we don't know how many people could have overheard our meeting and told her."
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Or somebody at the meeting could have blabbed to her.
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"No, they couldn't have. The parchment we all signed was enchanted, like I said. No one can betray the D.A. without us knowing."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"What would we do without you, Hermione? Hedwig!"
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,She's hurt!
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,She doesn't look very good.
Hermione Granger,Minerva McGonagall,"Harry, you'd better take her to Professor Grubby-Plank. She'll know what to do."
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,Potter! Where on earth are you going at this time of night?
Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,It's Hedwig. I think she's been attacked.
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"What? Yes, I think you might be right, Potter."
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,Where was she coming from?
Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,London.
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"Well, give her to me. I'll run her down to  Professsor Grubby-Plank. There you are. Bear in mind, Potter, that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts are being watched, won't you?"
Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,"Yes, Professor."
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"Good. Now, off to bed."
Dobby,Harry Potter,Mr. Harry Potter!
Harry Potter,Dobby,Dobby! What are you doing here?
Dobby,Harry Potter,"Dobby is cleaning, sir."
Harry Potter,Dobby,"What is it, Dobby."
Dobby,Harry Potter,Dobby...Dobby wishes he could help Harry Potter. Dobby has heard him muttering in his sleep.
Harry Potter,Dobby,"Don't worry about it, Dobby. But I don't think you can help me. Actually, there is something you can do, Dobby. I need a room where twenty-eight people can practice Defense Against the Dark Arts without the teachers knowing. Especially Professor Umbridge."
Dobby,Harry Potter,"Dobby knows of the perfect place, Harry Potter! It is the Room of Requirement, sir. You can only use the room in times of great need. Whatever you need will be there for you, Harry Potter."
Harry Potter,Dobby,"That's brilliant, Dobby!"
Dobby,Harry Potter,"Dobby can show you now, if you wish, Harry Potter."
Harry Potter,Dobby,"Better not, Dobby. School is pretty intense right now. We'll do it ina few months, before the holidays."
Lee Jordan,Students,...and Slytherin is up forty to ten. Alica with the quaffle!
Students,Harry Potter,"Weasley is our King, Weasley is our King, He always lets the Quaffle in, Weasley is our King!"
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Just ignore them, Ron!"
Lee Jordan,Students,Another ten points to Slyterin. The score is now fifty-ten in favor of Slytherin.
Draco Malfoy,Ron Weasley,"I should thank you, Weasley. You're definitely our best player!"
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Harry, are you all right?"
Draco Malfoy,Harry Potter,"Bet you loved that, Potter! Saved Weasley's neck, didn't you? I've never seen a worse Keeper! Maybe we should add some more verses to our little song. About his filthy mother! And his pathetic loser of a father too! But then, you like the Weasleys, don't you? How can you stand the stink? I guess it reminds you of your own dear mother!"
Rolanda Hooch,Everybody,Impedimenta! What on earth do you think you're doing?
Rolanda Hooch,Harry Potter,"Don't make me stupify you, Potter!"
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"My office. Now. In all my thirty-nine years at this school, I have never seen such a disgusting display."
Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,Malfoy provoked us.
Minerva McGonagall,Dolores Umbridge,"Of course he wanted to provoke you! He'd just lost! I cannot express in words the disappointment I feel right now. What is it, Dolores?"
Dolores Umbridge,Minerva McGonagall,I thought you might need some additional authority in dealing with these two.
Minerva McGonagall,Dolores Umbridge,You thought wrong. Now kindly remove yourself from my office. 
Minerva McGonagall,Everybody,"Now, I don't care what Malfoy said. Your performance out there was shameful. Fifty points from Gryffindor, and I'm giving you both a week's worth of detentions."
Dolores Umbridge,Minerva McGonagall,"I hardly think that's an adequate punishment for this. Educational Decree Twenty-Five. It gives me, as High Inquisitor, the power to give punishments and privileges, and to alter those given out to students by other members of the staff. So, I think a life-long ban from playing quidditch should do the trick for both of these. Oh, and this one's twin as well. He was going to attack Malfoy as well."
Harry Potter,Dolores Umbridge,Ban us...for life.
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,"Yes, indeed, Mr. Potter. Ah, I'll take your brooms as well. Well, have a wonderful day."
Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,You've--!
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"My hands are tied, Potter."
Angelina Johnson,Ron Weasley,I can't believe it...three players banned for life in one day...
Ron Weasley,Angelina Johnson,I'm going to resign.
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,You can't!
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,I'm horrible! I should never have joined.
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"If you quit, we'll be out four players!"
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,This is the worst day of my life.
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,I know something that could cheer you up. 
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Hermione, give it up."
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,Hagrid's back!
Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,"Hagrid, what happened to you?"
Rubeus Hagrid,Ron Weasley,"I've fine, I tell yeh!"
Ron Weasley,Rubeus Hagrid,"Come off it, Hagrid! We're not blind!"
Hermione Granger,Rubeus Hagrid,Was it because of the giants?
Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,"Can' answer tha', I'm afraid. Top secret, that is. Business of the Order."
Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,"We know you were looking for giants, Hagrid. Dumbledore said so last year."
Rubeus Hagrid,Ron Weasley,"Oh. Well, yeah, I was, then. Went with Madame Maxime. Took us a month to get to their camp."
Ron Weasley,Rubeus Hagrid,A month?
Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,"O' course! Can' do magic, not with the Ministry followin' us all the way. Plus, giants aren't fond o' wizards. Don' trust 'em."
Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,So what did you do when you found them?
Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,Waited 'till mornin' an' then marched righ' in.
Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,"We gave 'em gift, jus' like Dumbldore said. Gave 'em a branch o' Gubraithian fire, Everlasting Flame. Giants love magic, see, jus' not too fond o' wizards. Nuthin'. Giant loves better than magic."
Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,What happened then?
Rubeus Hagrid,Harry Potter,"We sat down, an' had a talk. Well, mostly they listened good. But there were good signs. Well, they did 'till tha' night. Tha's when everythin' went wrong. There were a coup. Nex' mornin' there were a new chief. We went back ter see what we could do with this new chief. An' thn things got even worse. Death Eaters arrived, an' the new chief were all happy ter be seein' them! We figured, jus' cause some o' the giants were favorin' You-Know-Who don't  mean all of 'em were. The coup ha' driven the ol' chief's supporters into some caves, so we wen' in after 'em."
Ron Weasley,Rubeus Hagrid,You went into caves looking for giants?
Rubeus Hagrid,Ron Weasley,"We foun' enough, an' they seemed interested-- at first. Then the new chief's lot raided the caves. Tweren't many survivors, an' none o' them wanted anythin' to do with us after tha'."
Ron Weasley,Rubeus Hagrid,So...no giants are coming?
Rubeus Hagrid,Ron Weasley,"Well, not righ' away. We brought our message, an' I expec' a fair few'll remember it afore teh end comes."
Harry Potter,Everybody,Glad to see all of you could find this place all right.
Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,"Hey, Harry, what is all this stuff?"
Harry Potter,Neville Longbottom,Loads of Defense Against the Dark Arts equipment. Hopefully we'll be able to get to all of it before the end of term.
Harry Potter,Neville Longbottom,"You need to understand something before we start, though. Defending yourself frm the Dark Arts has less to do with magical ability and more to do with thinking fast and a lot of luck. "
Zacharias Smith,Harry Potter,Oh please. Professor Lockhart taught us that in second year.
Ron Weasley,Zacharias Smith,Lockhart didn't teach as much as prune himself.
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,"Besides, it works. I used it against You-Know-Who last June. It saved my life. Right. Well, let's split into pairs and give it a go."
Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,Expelliarmus!
Harry Potter,Neville Longbottom,"Well done, Neville! Look here, you lot! Neville's really got the hang of this one."
Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,Expelliarmus! I did it! I did it!
Harry Potter,Neville Longbottom,"Never forget this spell, Neville. It could save your live some day. Okay, Everybody. We've done a lot today, and I've seen some great improvement. That's it for now. We'll meet back here, same time next week!"
Neville Longbottom,Ron Weasley,What's wrong with him?
Ron Weasley,Minerva McGonagall,Get McGonagall! Go! Harry! HARRY!
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"Potter! Wake up, Potter. Wake up. Please..."
Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,Mr. Weasley's been attacked!
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"You dreamed this, Potter?"
Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,"No, I saw it happen! I...I was there..."
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"You're sure this happened, Potter? "
Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,Yes! We've got to do something or he will die!
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"We're going to see the Headmaster, Potter."
Minerva McGonagall,Ron Weasley,"Weasley, you'd best come too."
Albus Dumbledore,Minerva McGonagall,"Professor McGonagall, and...ah... What can I do for you?"
Minerva McGonagall,Albus Dumbledore,"Well, Potter has had some kind of nightmare..."
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"It wasn't a nightmare! Well, I was asleep, but it wasn't  a normal dream. It was… well, real. I saw, well--Mr.Weasley has been attacked by a gian snake."
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,How did you see this? How were you positioned when you saw it?
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Oh. Uh...I was the snake. I saw it from the snake's perspective.
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Is Arthur seriously injured?
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Yes!
Albus Dumbledore,Everard,You were listening?
Everard,Albus Dumbledore,Naturally.
Albus Dumbledore,Everybody,"Raise the alarm. We must make sure Arthur is found by the right people. Many of our previous headmasters and mistresses have portraits in other institutions, allowing them to move between them. Fawkes, we will need a warning. Naturally, naturally. What news?"
Everard,Albus Dumbledore,I shouted until someone came. They carried him up seconds ago. He doesn't look good. Covered in blood...
Dilys Derwent,Albus Dumbledore,"Dumbledore, I've just seen them arrive at St. Mungos. Apperated there moments ago. He looks really bad."
Albus Dumbledore,Minerva McGonagall,"Good. Minerva, the rest of the Weasleys will need to be awoken.  "
Albus Dumbledore,Phineas Nigellus Black,"Phineas. Phineas, I need you to visit your other portrait. Tell Sirius what happened and that we are coming to stay for a while"
Phineas Nigellus Black,Albus Dumbledore,"It's late, Dumbledore... I'm going, I'm going..."
Albus Dumbledore,black pot,Portus
Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,"Harry, what's happening"
Albus Dumbledore,Ginny Weasley,"Your father has been injured in the course of his work for the Order. He is alive and arrived at St.Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injures only moments ago. We, however, are going to Sirius's house until the morning. We're merely waiting for Phineas to return. Fawkes's warnign. Umbridge knows you're out of bed"
Albus Dumbledore,Minerva McGonagall,"Minerva, head her off. Tell her anything you can think of. "
Phineas Nigellus Black,Albus Dumbledore,He says he'd be delighted
Albus Dumbledore,Phineas Nigellus Black,We're going by Portkey
Sirius Black,Albus Dumbledore,There you are.
Ginny Weasley,Sirius Black,We've got to go to St. Mungo's
Sirius Black,Ginny Weasley,"No, you can’t"
George Weasley,Sirius Black,We can go where we please.
Sirius Black,George Weasley,We can't go yet. It would look to suspicious if you lot showed up fifteen minutes after Arthur arrives because Harry's been seeing visions of things happening hundreds of miles from Hogwarts.
George Weasley,Sirius Black,That's our father out there dying!
Sirius Black,George Weasley,I can't let you leave. I'm sorry.
Fred Weasley,Sirius Black,You don't even care! You wouldn't even understand!
Sirius Black,Fred Weasley,I was part of the first Order. I lost my best friends to You-Know-Who.
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"He's all I have left of them. Believe me, I don't want Arthur to die. But there are some things worth dying for!"
Mrs.Weasley,Everybody,Your father's alive. He's going to make it.
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,"Siriuse, I --"
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"You can tell me, Harry."
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,"When I saw the attack, well, I was the snake."
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,What?
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,"I felt the fangs like they were mine, saw through the snake's eyes like they were mine…I think I ight be going mad."
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,Nonsense. You're just tired. You've had a rough night.
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,But what if there's a snake inside me?
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,You've told Dumbledore this? Then there's nothing to worry about.
Nymphadora Tonks,mannequin,We're here to see Arthur Weasley.
Mrs.Weasley,Everybody,"This way, come one!"
Nymphadora Tonks,Mrs.Weasley,"We'll wait outside at first, Molly. It should be family first."
Mrs.Weasley,Harry Potter,"Don't be silly, Harry. You too."
Mrs.Weasley,Everybody,"Hullo, Everybody!"
Mrs.Weasley,Arthur Weasley,"How are you, dear?"
Arthur Weasley,Mrs.Weasley,"I am absolutely fine. If they could take the bandages off, I'd walk out of here in a jiffy"
Fred Weasley,Arthur Weasley,"How come they haven't taken them off, then?"
Arthur Weasley,Fred Weasley,"Oh, I start bleeding like mad. The snake had some strange poison in it. Kees the wounds open. But they'll find a curve, don't you doubt."
George Weasley,Arthur Weasley,"What were you doing when it happened, dad?"
Arthur Weasley,George Weasley,That's my own business.
Fred Weasley,Arthur Weasley,"You were guarding it, weren't you? This weapon thing?"
Mrs.Weasley,Fred Weasley,That's enough!
Mrs.Weasley,Arthur Weasley,"Moody and Tonks are outside, Arthur. They're like a word."
Mrs.Weasley,Everybody,"All of you, out, if you please."
Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"Harry, stay a moment. I never thanked you properly."
Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,There's no need--
Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"But there is, Harry. If you hadn't had your vision, no one would have found me in time. So… Thank you."
Nymphadora Tonks,Arthur Weasley,"…we searched the whole floor, Arthr, but we couldn’t find that snake. Why a snake, anyway?"
Alastor Moody,Nymphadora Tonks,"He probably sent it as lookout. See what he's up against. That's the closest he's ever gotten to it. So, Potter says he saw the whole thing?"
Mrs.Weasley,Alastor Moody,"Yes. You know, Dumbledore seems like he's been waiting for something like this to happen. When I spoke to him this morning, he seemed very worried about Harry."
Alastor Moody,Mrs.Weasley,"He should be. I mean, if You-Know-Who is really possessing him…"
Gilderoy Lockhart,Everybody,Hullo.
Hermione Granger,Gilderoy Lockhart,Professor Lockhart!
Gilderoy Lockhart,Everybody,"Professor? Me? Did I really? Well, I expect I was hopeless at i! Now, I'll expect alll of you will be wanting my autograph?"
Harry Potter,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Uh, sure…"
Healer,Gildroy,"Ah, there you went, Gildroy. He keeps wandering off, handing out autographs, don't you know? It's a good sign toward recovering his memory, the poor dear."
Ron Weasley,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Yeah, sorry about that, mate."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Ron Weasley,Have we met?
Ron Weasley,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Yeah, it was my wand that backfired on you."
Healer,Ron Weasley,Was it? What a coincidence!
Healer,Gilderoy Lockhart,"This is our long-term resident ward, for permanent spell damage. Well, I must go…"
Mrs.Longbottom,Neville Longbottom,"Come along, Neville."
Ron Weasley,Neville Longbottom,"Hey, Neville!"
Mrs.Longbottom,Neville Longbottom,"Friends of yours, Neville?"
Mrs.Longbottom,Harry Potter,"Ah, yes, Harry Potter. Good to meet you, finally. "
Mrs.Longbottom, George Weasley,And a Weasley.
Mrs.Longbottom,Hermione Granger,and you must be Miss Granger. Neville's mentioned you.
Ron Weasley,Neville Longbottom,"Who're you visiting, Neville?"
Mrs.Longbottom,Neville Longbottom,You haven't told them?
Hermione Granger,Mrs.Longbottom,Told us what?
Mrs.Longbottom,Hermione Granger,"Neville's dear parents were tortured into insanity by You-Know-Who before he disappeared. Aurors, you know, very well respected."
Mrs.Longbottom,Neville Longbottom,"Another one, Alice? All right, come on,  Neville."
Hermione Granger,Neville Longbottom,I never knew… Poor Neville
Mrs.Weasley,Harry Potter,"Are you all right, Harry dear? You look like you're going to be sick."
Phineas Nigellus Black,Harry Potter,"Running away, are we?"
Harry Potter,Phineas Nigellus Black,I have to.
Phineas Nigellus Black,Harry Potter,You know. I thought Gryffindors had to be brave.
Harry Potter,Phineas,I won't hurt anybody else.
Phineas Nigellus Black,Harry Potter,"I see. You are running away out of nobility. You know, that's why I hated teaching. Young people always think they know what's best, as if no one else could possibly understand things better."
Phineas Nigellus Black,Harry Potter,I've brought a message from Dumbledore.
Harry Potter,Phineas,What is it?
Phineas Nigellus Black,Harry Potter,Dumbledore says 'Stay where you are.'
Harry Potter,Phineas,That's it? Stay there while the grown-ups sort things out?
Phineas Nigellus Black,Harry Potter,"When in all your life has listening to Dumbledore ever led you into trouble? Whatever his reasons, he has your best interests at heart, Potter."
Harry Potter,Phineas,Fine! Go! And tell Dumbledore thanks for nothing!
Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,Get out!
Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,No.
Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,Ginny. I'm dangerous. You can't be around me.
Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,Did you forget that I've been possessed by You-Know-Who before?
Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,I forgot.
Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,"Lucky you. Anyway, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. Can you remember everything you've done this year? There aren't any blank spots in your memory?"
Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,"No, I don’t think so."
Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,"Then You-Know-Who has never possessed you, Harry. I don't know what's going on with you right now, but possession's not one of them. You're not dangerous."
Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,"Thanks, Ginny."
Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,Don't mention it. 
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"Harry, have you seen Kreaher? I haven't seen him for days now."
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,Haven't seen him.
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,Oh well. Maybe he's crawled up into th air ducts and died… mustn't get my hopes up though.
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"Potter, excellent. I'd like a word."
Sirius Black,Severus Snape,"You know, I don't like people giving orders in my house."
Severus Snape,Sirius Black,How unfortunate for you. Now kindly get out. My instructions from Dumbledore are to talk with Potter alone.
Sirius Black,Severus Snape,I'm his godfather. I think I'll stay.
Severus Snape,Sirius Black,"Very well, then. I know how you like to pretend you're useful."
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"It is the Headmaster's wish that I teach you Occulumency, Potter."
Harry Potter,Severus Snape,What's that?
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"Occlumency. It I an acient form of magic that allows you to defend your mind from external intrusion. We begin at six-o-clock on Monday, Potter."
Severus Snape,Sirius Black,"Well, unlike Sirius here. I don’t have unlimited leisure time."
Sirius Black,Severus Snape,"Just a second, Snape. If I hear that you're using this to give Harry a hard time, you'll have me to answer to. "
Severus Snape,Sirius Black,How touching. Yet Potter is incredibly like his father. Criticism simply bounces off of him.
Sirius Black,Severus Snape,"I've warned you, Snivellus. Dumbledore may think you've reformed, but I now better…"
Severus Snape,Sirius Black,"Touch me one more time, Black, and you won't touch anything again."
Cho Chang,Harry Potter,"Hi, Harry."
Harry Potter,Cho Chang,Hi.
Cho Chang,Harry Potter,Er… bye then.
Harry Potter,Cho Chang,"Hey Cho! Well, uh, Valentine's Day is the same day as our next Hogsmead visit.Well, uh, would you like to, you know, go with me?"
Cho Chang,Harry Potter,Sure!
Harry Potter,Cho Chang,Cool.
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"Sit, Potter. As you are well aware, I will be teaching you Occlumency. The headmaster feels you should learn this form of magic to defend yourself against the Dark Lord, who is skilled at Legilimency."
Harry Potter,Severus Snape,"What's that, Professor?"
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,Legilimency is the ability to extract thoughts and feelings from others.
Harry Potter,Severus Snape,Voldemort can read minds?
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"As usual, you have all the subtlety of a stone wall, Potter. The mind is not a book, of which any page can be examined. The mind is complex and multi-layered."
Harry Potter,Severus Snape,So he could read our minds right now? 
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"Eye contact is normally required for Legilimency to work. In your case, however, things are somewhat different. Your scar has forged a connection between you and the Dark Lord. When your mind is most relaxed, such as during sleep, you receive the Dark Lord's thoughts and feelings. The Headmaster believes that it is inadvisble for this to continue."
Harry Potter,Severus Snape,"But hasn't it helped so far? I mean, it saved Mr. Weasley's life, didn't it?"
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"Yes, it did, but at the expense of our advantage. The connection between you was so powerful during your vision of the snake that the Dark Lord became aware of it. The Headmaster fears that he may try to use this to his advantage, to manipulate you through false visions. Wand out, Potter. You may use any spell you can think of to try and repel me."
Harry Potter,Severus Snape,What are you going to do?
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,I am going to break into your mind.
Harry Potter,Severus Snape,No!
Severus Snape,Arthur Weasley,"Well, you stopped me eventually. Ideally, you should repel me with your mind. Clear your mind, Potter. Abandon your emotions. Legilimens"
Arthur Weasley,Harry Potter,"Come on, Harry!"
Harry Potter,Arthur Weasley,I've been there before...
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,What was that?
Harry Potter,Severus Snape,I've just realized...
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"Realized what, Potter?"
Harry Potter,Severus Snape,"What's in the Department of Mysteries, sir?"
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,What did you say?
Harry Potter,Severus Snape,"That corridor, I've been dreaming about it for months...it leads to the Department of Mysteries, I'm sure of it."
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"There are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter, none of which concern you."
Trelawney,Dolores Umbridge,You cannot sack me!
Dolores Umbridge,Sybill Trelawney,I can do whatever I wish!
Sybill Trelawney,Dolores Umbridge,This is my home!
Dolores Umbridge,Albus Dumbledore,Not anymore. Now remove yourself from this castle!
Albus Dumbledore,Dolores Umbridge,She will not be leaving.
Dolores Umbridge,Albus Dumbledore," I have the authority, Headmaster!"
Albus Dumbledore,Dolores Umbridge,"Oh, I agree with you, Professor Umbridge. You do have the power to dismiss my teachers. However... -..-You cannot send them from this"
Dolores Umbridge,Albus Dumbledore,And what of her quarters when I appoint a new teacher.
Albus Dumbledore,Dolores Umbridge,"Happily, that will not be necessary. I have found a successor ...the Ministry can only appoint new teachers if I cannot find one. I think you will find him suitable enough. This is Firenze."
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,So you're saying this weapon You- Know-Who's after is in the Department of Mysteries?
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,It's got to be.
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,That's got to be what Surgis Podmore was doing in the Ministry when he was arrested.
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Probably. Mr. Weasley was probably there when he was attacked, too. That must be what the Order's guarding!"
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,But why the Department of Mysteries?
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"It makes perfect sense, Ron. It's got to be something the Ministry's been developing. Something top secret. Look at this. There's been a mass escape from Azkaban."
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Bloody hell!
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,They're all Death Eaters!
Hermione Granger,Everybody,Yes.
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Voldemort.
Cho Chang,Harry Potter,"Hi, Harry."
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Have fun, Harry. Meet me in The Three Broomsticks after. There's something you need to do."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Ok
Cho Chang,Harry Potter,"You know, Cedric and I came here last year. Before…I've been meaning to ask you for ages.. But.. I mean"
Harry Potter,Cho Chang,What?
Cho Chang,Harry Potter,Did Cedric say anything about me before he…he--died?
Harry Potter,Cho Chang,"Oh. Uh, no, there wasn't really much time…Look, maybe we should tak about something else…"
Cho Chang,Harry Potter,I thought you'd want to talk about it! I thought you'd understand!
Cho Chang,Harry Potter,"See you around, Harry."
Harry Potter,Rita Skeeter,What's this all about?
Rita Skeeter,Harry Potter,That's what Little Miss Perfect was about to tell us. 
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Right, well, I figured tha with all of the negative press out about Harry, he should have a chance to defend himself. All of the details. What happened last summer. The truth about Sirius Black and Voldemort, not to mention the names of all the Death Eaters still on the loose."
Rita Skeeter,Hermione Granger,The Prophet will never publish that. Goes agaisnt the public mood.
Hermione Granger,Rita Skeeter,"Well, it doesn't matter. We've found a publisher for the article."
Rita Skeeter,Hermione Granger,Who?
Luna Lovegood,Rita Skeeter,My father. He's the editor of the Quibbler. 
Rita Skeeter,Luna Lovegood,"The Quibbler? You think people will take Harry Potter seriously if he's publised in the Quibbler? It's nothing but a conspiracy theory, cock-and-bull story tabloid!"
Hermione Granger,Rita Skeeter,"Some won't believe Harry, that's true. But every person we do convince is one more ally."
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"So, Harry. Ready to tell the public the truth?"
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Yeah, I guess so."
Hermione Granger,Rita Skeeter,"Fire away, Rita."
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Look, Harry! It's your article!"
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,What on earth?
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Fan mail, Harry! Responses to the article."
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,"Which article is that, dear?"
Harry Potter,Dolores Umbridge,I have just published an article telling the real story about what happened last June.
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,"Where is this article? Right, I will confiscate this. Anyone found possession of this magazine will be expelled."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,What?
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,She's done it to herself. Banning the article will only make people want to read it more.
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"We've been doing so well, I though we'd work on some defensive blocking spells tonight.That was really good. "
Dobby,Harry Potter,Mr. Harry Potter!
Harry Potter,Dobby,"What is it, Dobby."
Dobby,Harry Potter,She--
Harry Potter,Dobby,"Who, Dobby? Is it Umbridge?"
Dobby,Harry Potter,"She knws, Harry Potter. She's coming!"
Harry Potter,Dobby,Get out of here! Now!
Draco Malfoy,Harry Potter,"Got you, Potter. Over here, Professor! I've got one!"
Dolores Umbridge,Draco Malfoy,"It's him. Well done, Draco!"
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,"On your feet, Potter. We're going to see the Headmaster!"
Dolores Umbridge,Draco Malfoy,"Search everywhere for the others, Draco. Round them all up. Check everywhere, bathrooms, the library, empty classrooms. We must find them!"
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"You may be High Inquisitor of this school, Professor Umbridge, but kindly do not manhandle my students."
Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,"Well, well, well, Mr.Potter! I expect you know why you're here?"
Harry Potter,Cornelius Fudge,"Not really, no."
Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,You don’t? You haven't broken any school rules?
Harry Potter,Cornelius Fudge,School rules? No.
Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,Or Ministrerial Decrees?
Harry Potter,Cornelius Fudge,Not that I know of.
Dolores Umbridge,Everybody,I'm afraid the poor girl is unable to speak. But I shall tell you what has transpired. Shortly after dinner she came to me and said that if I went to the Room of Requirement I would fnd n illegally-formed student group. It was at that time this hex took affect. 
Dolores Umbridge,Albus Dumbledore,Since I had received information some time ago that Potter and a number of other students had met in the Hog's Head to start an illegal group--
Albus Dumbledore,Dolores Umbridge,"I'm not sure that's true, Professor."
Dolores Umbridge,Albus Dumbledore,I'm sorry?
Albus Dumbledore,Dolores Umbridge,"In point of fact, when young Potter met those students it was not illegal."
Dolores Umbridge,Albus Dumbledore,"But two days later, Educational Decree Twenty-Four was introduced."
Albus Dumbledore,Dolores Umbridge,"Again, quite correct. However, I wonder if you have any evidence that proves this group has been meeting since then?"
Dolores Umbridge,Albus Dumbledore,I have a witness right here!
Albus Dumbledore,Dolores Umbridge,"Correct again. I must confess that I was, however, under the impression that this young girl only told you a meeting was going on tonight."
Dolores Umbridge,Albus Dumbledore,"Let's ask her, shall we? "
Dolores Umbridge,Marietta,"You can shake your head for an answer, dear. Now, have there been more meetings? What do you mean by shaking your head, girl? "
Albus Dumbledore,Dolores Umbridge,I would think that she was saying there have been no other meetings.
Albus Dumbledore,Marietta,Would that be correct?
Dolores Umbridge,Albus Dumbledore,"But what about Porter? He was the leader, and has been--"
Dolores Umbridge,Marietta,"Why are you saking your head, girl?"
Minerva McGonagall,Dolores Umbridge,"It usually means 'no', Dolores."
Albus Dumbledore,Dolores Umbridge,"Again, I cannot have you manhandling my students, Professor Umbridge."
Dolores Umbridge,Cornelius Fudge,"My apologies, Headmaster. I forgot myself."
Cornelius Fudge,Dolores Umbridge,"Well, what about the meeting tonight? "
Dolores Umbridge,Cornelius Fudge,"Right. Of course. Well, we proceeded down to the Room and entered. We caught Potter just outside. But it doesn't matter. We've found all of their names."
Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,"So, Dumbledore, you've been behind this whole thing. Dumbledore's Army."
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"Well, Minister. You've caught me."
Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,This has all been your doing! You've been recruiting students for your army!
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"Quite correct, Cornelius."
Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,I knew it! I KNEW it! You've been plotting against me all this time! This is too good to be true!
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Professor, no!"
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Quiet, Harry!"
Cornelius Fudge,Harry Potter,"Yes, shut up, Potter. So, you'll be coming with us to the Ministry--"
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"Ah, yes. I was wondering when we'd hit that little snag."
Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,"I see no snag, Dumbledore."
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,But I do. You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I would 'come quietly.'
Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,"Resisting arrest, now are you, Dumbledore?"
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"Precisely. You see, I have absolutely no intention of going to Azkaban."
Albus Dumbledore,Hawkes,"Don't be silly, Hawkes. Leave the wand there."
Cornelius Fudge,Hawkes,"You would really take on two Aurors, Dolores, and my self, Dumbledore?"
Albus Dumbledore,Everybody,"Naturally. All of you did rather well on your spellwork at this school, but if you attempt to take me in by force, I'm afraid I shall have to hurt you. Are you all right?"
Minerva McGonagall,Albus Dumbledore,"Yes, we're fine.Oh, where will you go, Albus?"
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,I'm not going into hiding. Fudge will soon regret removing me from Hogwarts.
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"I'm so sorry, Professor!"
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"It's fine. Now listen to me, Harry. Keep studying Occlumency! Do everything Professor Snape tells you. Close your mind! You will understand, in time. Fudge is stirring. Lay back down. They must not think we have had time to talk."
Cornelius Fudge,Everybody,Find him!
Dolores Umbridge,Everybody,"""By Order of the Ministry of Magic: Dolores Jane Umbridge will replace Albus Dumbledore as Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."" My first act as your new Headmistress is to form an Inquisitional Squad, lead by Draco Malfoy. They will report directly to me about the goings on in the halls of this school. Furthermore, our good caretaker, Mr. Filch has requested we reinstate the 'old punishments.' I have decided that there is no reason we shouldn't."
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Are you sure you can't? Hagrid said it was important.
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"No way. Quidditch practice. If I don't show up, Angelina'll go mad."
Hermione Granger,Rubeus Hagrid,Hagrid...we've been walking for a good hour.
Rubeus Hagrid,Hermione Granger,"Its jus' up ahead, here."
Harry Potter,Rubeus Hagrid,"Could you tell us what it is, Hagrid, please?"
Rubeus Hagrid,harry Potter,"All righ'. Well, I'm showin' yeh this, because tha' Umbridge woman put me on probation. I can' last much longer afore I get sacked like Trelawney."
Hermione Granger,Rubeus Hagrid,We won't let her! 
Rubeus Hagrid,Hermione Granger,"Bah. S'not the end o' the world. If I do, I'll go help Dumbledore. Grea' man… Anway, I wouldn' tell yeh' cept for tha'. I can't leave withou' makin' arraignmen's see? I'll need all o' yer help."
Rubeus Hagrid,Hermione Granger,"Knew yeh'd say yes! Okay, real quiet like from here on. There we are!"
Hermione Granger,Rubeus Hagrid,"Hagrid, I thought none of them wanted to come!"
Rubeus Hagrid,Hermione Granger,"None o' them did, Hermione! I didn' have much ruddy choice inna matter! I couldn' leave 'im!"
Hermione Granger,Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh, why, Hagrid? Why?"
Rubeus Hagrid,Grawp,"He's me brother! Well, half-brother anyway. Me mum had 'im afore she died. Here. I'll introduce yeh to Grawp! Yeh all righ', Grawp? Look wha' I brough' yeh, Grawpy! Two new friends an' all. We 'ave Harry Potter here, see? An' over here is Hermy."
Grawp,Rubeus Hagrid,Hermy!
Rubeus Hagrid,Bane,"Bad Grawpy! Bad boy! We don' attack our friends, Grawpy! See, he don' know any better. Anyway, all yeh need teh do is go an' talk to 'im. Give 'ima bit o' company. Oh blimey..."
Bane,Rubeus Hagrid,"I thought we told you that you were no longer welcome in this place, Hagrid. You or that beast you brought from afar."
Rubeus Hagrid,Bane,S'not up to you who comes and goes in this forest.
Bane,Rubeus Hagrid,You stopped us from invoking our punishments on Firenze for becoming the servant of the humans at
Rubeus Hagrid,Bane,"Stopped yeh from committin' murder, yeh mean! "
Bane,Rubeus Hagrid,"Our ways are not yours, Hagrid. And now you bring that monster here… our patience with it wanes swiftly."
Rubeus Hagrid,Bane,"Well, you'll tolerate 'im as long as he's here!"
Bane,Rubeus Hagrid,"We allow you to pass this time, Hagrid, because you have young with you. But the next time you enter this forest, your life is forfeit."
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"Please sit, Potter. You're here to have a talk with me about your career thoughts, Potter. We do this so we can begin to aim your courses over the next years to prepare you for that career. "
Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,"Oh, yeah. Well, I did think about being an Auror."
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"Auror. Interesting, Potter. You'll need to top grades for that. Challenging career path, but not unrewarding."
Dolores Umbridge,Minerva McGonagall,Hem hem.
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"Now then, Potter, you'll need to concentrate on Defense Agains the Dark Arts, Potions, Transfiguration, and Charms to adequately prepare yourself for the general Auror requirements"
Dolores Umbridge,Minerva McGonagall,Hem hem.
Minerva McGonagall,Dolores Umbridge,"May I offer you a cough drop, Professor Umbridge?"
Dolores Umbridge,Minerva McGonagall,"Oh, no thank you, Minerva. Actually, I was just wondering if Potter has the proper temperament to be an Auror"
Minerva McGonagall,Dolores Umbridge,Were you indeed.
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"If you're serious in this ambition, Potter, I would recommend concentrating on bringing your Potions and Charms grades up before your O.W.L.s I daresay you've got enough time if you apply yourself. Lords knows you've consistently done well in Defense Against the Dark Arts. Professor Lupin."
Dolores Umbridge,Minerva McGonagall,"Excuse me, Minerava, but have you seen my note on Porter's current grades in my class?"
Minerva McGonagall,Dolores Umbridge,"Yes, indeed I have."
Dolores Umbridge,Minerva McGonagall,Then I think you will find that Potter's grades have been consistently poor this year. 
Minerva McGonagall,Dolores Umbridge,"You apparently misunderstand me. I meant that Potter has done well in every Denfense Against the Dark Arts class taugh by compeent teacher. Now, assuming you've passed all of your necessary classes, the Ministry will put you through a number of character and aptitude tests."
Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,What's involved in them?
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"How you stand up under pressure, your persevance, and dedication, things of this nature."
Dolores Umbridge,Minerva McGonagall,Harry Poter has no chance of ever becoming an Auror!
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"I will assit you in becoming an Auror if it the very last thing I do, Potter! I will coach you nightly in order to get the necessary grades! This concludes our meeting, Potter."
Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,"Thanks, Professor. "
Minerva McGonagall,Harry Potter,"You're welcome, Potter. Now hurry or you'll be late for Occlumency."
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"Have you been practicing, Potter?"
Harry Potter,Severus Snape,Yeah.
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"Well, we shall see, won't we?"
Draco Malfoy,Severus Snape,"Excuse me, Professor. Professor Umbridge says she needs you right away."
Severus Snape,Draco Malfoy,What on earth for?
Draco Malfoy,Severus Snape,"Well, sir, remember when Montegue vanished over Christmas? She says he's turned up in a toilet on the fourth floor."
Severus Snape,Draco Malfoy,Any idea how he got there?
Draco Malfoy,Severus Snape,"He's pretty confused, but I think he said something about the Vanishing Closet. "
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"We will pick your remedial potions lesson up tomorrow, Potter."
Sirius Black,James Potter,"Put that away, James. I'm bored. Wish it was full moon."
Remus Lupin,James Potter,Easy for you to say.
James Potter,Sirius Black,"This should cheer you up, Sirius. Look."
Sirius Black,James Potter,Excellent! Snivellus!
James Potter,Sirius Black,"All right, there, Snivellus?"
Sirius Black,James Potter,Expelliarmus!
James Potter,Sirius Black,Impedimenta!
Severus Snape,Snape,You just wait...
Sirius Black,James Potter,"Wait for what, Snivellus? You go wipe that great greasy nose on us?"
James Potter,Everybody,"And now, the moment you've all been waiting for--"
Lily Evens,James Potter,"Leave him alone, James Potter!"
James Potter,Lily Evens,"Another charity case, Lily?"
Lily Evens,James Potter,What has he done to you?
James Potter,Lily Evens,"Nothing. It's more the face that he exists, you see…"
Severus Snape,James Potter,Semper-——
James Potter,Lily Evens,Levicorpus!
Lily Evens,James Potter,"Leave him alone, Potter!"
James Potter,Lily Evens,I will if you go out with me.
Lily Evens,Sirius Black,I wouldn't go out with you if it were a choice between you and the giant squid! Now let him down.
Sirius Black,Lily Evens,Locomotor mortis!
Lily Evens,James Potter,"I said, leave him alone!"
James Potter,Lily Evens,"Don't make me hex you, Lily."
Lily Evens,James Potter,Then let him go!
James Potter,Lily Evens,Fine!
James Potter,Snivellus," You're lucky Lily was here, Snivellus!"
Severus Snape,James Potter,I don't need help from a mud-blood like her!
James Potter,Lily Evens,Apologize to her! Now!
Lily Evens,James Potter,"Don't make him apologize. Honestly, you're as bad as he is!"
James Potter,Lily Evens,I would never call you that.
Lily Evens,James Potter,"You make me sick, Potter."
James Potter,Lily Evens,Lily! Hey Lily!
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"Having fun, Potter?"
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,Been enjoying yourself?
Harry Potter,Severus Snape,No!
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"Amusing man, your father..."
Harry Potter,Severus Snape,I--sorry!
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,You will repeat what you saw to no one!
Harry Potter,Severus Snape,"No, of course not!"
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"You had better not, Potter, or you will experience a pain so horrible you will wish you had never been born!"
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,Now get out of my sight! Do not set foot in this office ever again!
McGonagall,whole school,"Today begins your O.W.L exams. A number of Ministry instructors are here to give them. Exams will take place for the next two weeks. Exams will be split in two parts, theory and practical application."
McGonagall,whole school,"I must warn you that the most stringent anti-cheating spells have been added to your exam papers. No student has successfully cheated on an O.W.L in a century, though every year someone tries it."
McGonagall,whole school,"Naturally, cheating will not be suffered and anyone caught will be explelled from Hogwarts."
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Oy! That's Umbridge down there!
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,They're heading for Hagrid's!
Professor Tofty,Students,"Eyes back on the sky, please."
Professor Tofty,Students,"twenty minutes left on your exam, students."
Harry Potter,Hawlish,No!
Hawlish,Rubeus Hagrid,"Be reasonable, Hagrid!"
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Look!
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,McGonagall'll sort this out!
McGonagall,Rubeus Hagrid,How dare you! How DARE you!
McGonagall,Rubeus Hagrid,Stop this immediately!
McGonagall,Hagrid,Enough!
Professor Tofty,Hagrid,Not even a warning!
Hagrid,everybody,COWARDS!
Dolores Umbridge,everybody,"Get him, get him!"
Professor Sprout,Professor Flitwick,Get her to the hospital wing right away.
Griselda Marchbanks,everybody,"Before we begin, I have an update on Professor McGonagall. She will be all right, and is resting in the hospital wing."
Griselda Marchbanks,everybody,You may now turn your papers over and begin.
Voldemort,Sirius Black,"Can you reach it? Can you take it for me, Black?"
Sirius Black,Voldemort,I would rather die!
Voldemort,Sirius Black,"Oh, you will die. Eventually. But there are hours, even days of pain awaiting you before then. "
Voldemort,Sirius Black,"I'm going to enjoy this, Black. I have you, and soon I shall have the weapon. And then not even your pathetic Order can stand in my way! "
Griselda Marchbanks,Harry Potter,"Are you all right, Potter? "
Griselda Marchbanks,Harry Potter,"Pressure of exams. It happens. Take a breath, and maybe you'll be ready to go back in. Time is nearly up, but--—"
Harry Potter,Griselda Marchbanks,"No--no, I've done all I can."
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,You all right?
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Voldemort! He's got Sirius! In the Department of Mysteries!
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,How do you know?
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,I just saw it. 
Harry Potter,"Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley",How're we going to get there?
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,To the Department of Mysteries?
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,We've got to do something!
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,"How'd Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without being seen? I mean, he and Sirius are the two most wanted wizards in the world..."
Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Yeah. They can't just waltz into the Ministry of Magic!
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"It just seems so unlikely, Harry!"
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,I won't let Sirius die!
Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,We heard Harry yelling. What's up?
Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,Voldemort's broken into the Department of Mysteries. He's got Sirius there!
Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,He could already have the weapon!
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Think, Harry! Voldemort knows you! He knows you'd rush off to save Sirius."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"There isn't anyone else, Hermione! Everybody from the Order is gone!"
Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,Anything we can do to help?
Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,"No, there isn't!"
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Yes, they can, Harry."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,How?
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Before we do anything, we need to establish that Sirius really isn't at Headquarters. Which means we'll need to break into Umbridge's office."
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"For that, we'll need a really good distraction."
Fred Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Right you are, Hermione. Think we can whip something up, George?"
George Weasley,Hermione Granger,Might be able to.
Fred Weasley,Hermione Granger,Just give us a few seconds.
Hermione Granger,Fred Weasley,"Mind you, it's got to be really good!"
George Weasley,Hermione Granger,"Not to worry, Hermione. We've got something that will outdue everything else we've done here combined."
Fred Weasley,Hermione Granger,It's been too quiet around here
George Weasley,Hermione Granger,Time we did some real damage to this place.
Hermione Granger,Ginny Weasley,We'll also need to keep Everybody away from her office.
Ginny Weasley,Hermione Granger,We can do that! Me and Luna'll guard the hallway.
Hermione Granger,Ginny Weasley,We'll probably only manage five minutes or so.
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,That's all we'll need.
Fred Weasley,Harry Potter,"Right. You've got ten minutes to get to Umbridge's office. And whatever you do, stay away from the Astronomy Tower for the next couple of hours."
George Weasley,Harry Potter,"Unless they spread, in which case, I'd get out of the castle for a while."
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Break out your Invisibility Cloak, Harry."
Argus Filch,Dolores Umbridge,Professor! It's those Weasley twins! They've set something off in the Astronomy Tower!
Dolores Umbridge,Argus Filch,Ready to try out the old punishments again?
Argus Filch,Dolores Umbridge,Tey've had this coming for a long time!
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Grimmauld Place!
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,Sirius! Are you here!
Fred Weasley,Argus Filch,That was worth it!
Argus Filch,Fred Weasley,I've got you now!
Fred Weasley,George Weasley,"Thank you for playing, one and all."
George Weasley,Fred Weasley,"And now, we've got to go!"
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,Sirius! Lupin? Hello?
Kreacher,Harry Potter,What's this? The Potter boy in the fire...
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,"Kreacher, where's Sirius?"
Kreacher,Harry Potter,Master went out.
Dolores Umbridge,Fred Weasley,"So, turning a hallway into a swamp is funny, is it?"
Fred Weasley,Dolores Umbridge,"Fairly amusing, yeah."
Dolores Umbridge,Fred Weasley,"Well, now you're going to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school."
Fred Weasley,Dolores Umbridge,This was never your school! Hogwarts is Dumbledore's school!
Dolores Umbridge,Fred Weasley,"Well, now you're going to get your punishments right here, in front of the whole school!"
George Weasley,Dolores Umbridge,"You know, I don't think we are."
Fred Weasley,George Weasley,"George, I think we've outgrown full- time education. Wouldn't you agree?"
George Weasley,Fred Weasley,"Completely, Fred."
Fred Weasley,George Weasley,Time to enter the real world?
George Weasley,Fred Weasley,Definitely.
Fred Weasley,Dolores Umbridge,Accio brooms!
George Weasley,Dolores Umbridge,Accio brooms!
Fred Weasley,Dolores Umbridge,We won't be seeing you.
George Weasley,Dolores Umbridge,"Yeah, don't bother writing."
Fred Weasley,Dolores Umbridge,Be sure to visit us at our new premises on Diagon Alley!
Harry Potter,Kreacher,"You know where he is, don't you?"
Kreacher,Harry Potter,Master does not tell Kreacher where he goes. 
Harry Potter,Kreacher,But you know.
Kreacher,Harry Potter,Master will never return from the Department of Mysteries!
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Harry!
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,You think you could simply walk into my office without me knowing about it? Foolish boy! 
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,Accio wand! 
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,Who were you trying to contact?
Harry Potter,Dolores Umbridge,It's none of your business.
Dolores Umbridge,Draco malfoy,"Draco, would you fetch Professor Snape, please? "
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,"Very well, Potter. I have been patient enough with you."
Severus Snape,Dolores Umbridge,You wished to see me?
Dolores Umbridge,Severus Snape,I have just caught Potter trying to communicate with someone in my fire. I need some Veritaserum. Truth syrum.
Severus Snape,Dolores Umbridge,"Well, it appears that I cannot help you. I have none."
Harry Potter,Dolores Umbridge,He's got Padfoot at the place it's hidden!
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,What? What does that mean?
Severus Snape,Harry Potter,"Potter, if I want nonsense shouted at me, I shall inform you. "
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,"We've played nicely, Potter. You leave me no choice!"
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,You could have saved me a lot of trouble if those Dementors I sent to your house had finished you off!
Harry Potter,Dolores Umbridge,You sent the Dementors?
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,Of course I did! Someone had to act!
Dolores Umbridge,Harry Potter,CRUCIO!
Hermione Granger,Dolores Umbridge,"No! Please, stop!"
Dolores Umbridge,Hermione Granger,"Well, well."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Hermione, no!"
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"We have to tell her, Harry..."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,I would rather die!
Dolores Umbridge,Hermione Granger,"Shut up, Potter! Now talk, you silly girl! Who were you talking to?"
Hermione Granger,Dolores Umbridge,We were trying to find Professor Dumbledore. We had to tell him...
Dolores Umbridge,Hermione Granger,Tell him?
Hermione Granger,Dolores Umbridge,That it's ready. The weapon.
Dolores Umbridge,Hermione Granger,You and Mr. Potter will take me to it. 
Dolores Umbridge,Hermione Granger,"Much further, is it?"
Hermione Granger,Dolores Umbridge,"Oh, yes. It's very well hidden."
Magorian,Dolores Umbridge,What are you doing in our forest?
Dolores Umbridge,Magorian,Your forest? This forest belongs to the Ministry of Magic! 
Dolores Umbridge,Magorian,"Stay back, you beasts!"
Dolores Umbridge,Magorian,You cannot attack me! Any attack on a wizard by a half-breed--
Hermione Granger,Dolores Umbridge,Don't call them that!
Magorian,Dolores Umbridge,You dare to insult us?
Dolores Umbridge,Magorian,Come no closer! 
Dolores Umbridge,Magorian,Incarcerus! 
Dolores Umbridge,Magorian,Ingrates! Animals! Filthy half- bloods!
Centaur,Dolores Umbridge,What of these two? 
Centaur,Dolores Umbridge,They have been here with Hagrid. They have heard the warnings and disobeyed. They must suffer the consequences!
Draco Malfoy,Ron Weasley,"God, I can't wait until all you Weasleys have been expelled. Your stench has been fouling this castle for too long."
Ron Weasley,Draco Malfoy,"Shut up, Malfoy!"
Draco Malfoy,Ron Weasley,"That's for speaking to me. You know, you Weasleys are just as bad as Mudbloods! "
Draco Malfoy,Ron Weasley,"You know, Weasley, it's really too bad Potter saved you from the Chamber of Secrets."
Ron Weasley,Draco Malfoy,Stupify!
Neville Longbottom,Everybody,Expelliarmus!
Grawp,Everybody,Haggar! 
Grawp,Everybody,Hermy! Where Haggar?
Hermione Granger,Grawp,"Grawp, help us!"
Grawp,Hermione Granger,Grawp save Hermy!
Grawp,Hermione Granger,GRAWP WANT HAGGAR!
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Great plan, Hermione."
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,I thought it worked out rather nicely.
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,What are we supposed to do now?
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,That's just what we were wondering. 
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"So, how do we get to the Ministry?"
Hermione Granger,Ron Weasley,I'd imagine we should fly.
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,We've got no brooms.
Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,There are other ways to fly. 
Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,"I mean, they can fly, and they're very good at finding places you need to go."
Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,What are those?
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,What are what?
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"There's nothing there, Harry."
Luna Lovegood,Neville Longbottom,"Yes, there is. They're Thestrals. You can't see them unless you've seen someone die."
Neville Longbottom,Luna Lovegood,I can see them too.
Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,"All right, then. Get on one, and we'll be off."
Ron Weasley,Luna Lovegood,And what about those of us who can't see them? 
Luna Lovegood,Ron Weasley,I'll show you.
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Never again...
Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,"What now, Harry?"
Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,"All right, come on."
Witch,Everybody,Department of Mysteries.
Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,Where is Everybody?
Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,The Ministry closed a half-hour ago. I expect they all went home.
Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,That's how Voldemort got in unnoticed.
Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley, This is it. Come on. 
Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,Stay close.
Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,Now where?
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"I don't understand. In my dream, the doors weren't identical."
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Well, let's try a few."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Yeah. I'll know the way when I see it. 
Harry Potter,Everybody,Who's there? 
Harry Potter,Everybody,Sirius?
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"There's no one here, Harry. This isn't the right room."
Harry Potter,Everybody,Does anyone else hear that?
Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,I do. It's coming from the Veil. 
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Harry…
Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,There are people in there!
Ron Weasley,Luna Lovegood,"What do you mean, people?"
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Harry, I think we should leave."
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Harry, we're here for Sirius, remember?"
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Sirius...yeah…
Harry Potter,Everybody,Alohomora!
Harry Potter,Everybody,"Whatever's in there, the Ministry sure doesn't want anyone getting to it. "
Harry Potter,Everybody,This is it! Come on! 
Harry Potter,Everybody,This is it. This is where Sirius is! 
Harry Potter,Everybody,He's in here somewhere.
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,I don't think Sirius is here.
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Harry, have you seen this? "
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Er...it's got your name on it.
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,What's my name doing here?
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Don't touch it, Harry!"
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Why not?
Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,"Yeah, Harry, don't."
Harry Potter,Neville Longbottom,It's got my name on it!
Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,"I warned you before that one day you would come to a sticky end, Potter."
Harry Potter,Lucius Malfoy,Where's Sirius?
Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,"We don't have him, if that's what you mean.  "
Harry Potter,Lucius Malfoy,"You never did, did you? It was all just a trick."
Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,"The Dark Lord knows your weakness for heroics, Potter. All it took was a little nudge to get you here."
Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter, Now give me that prophesy.
Harry Potter,Lucius Malfoy,What prophesy?
Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,That prophesy. Now hand it over or we'll have to use wands on you.
Harry Potter,Lucius Malfoy,Go ahead.
Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,"Very brave of you, Potter. Or are you foolish?"
Harry Potter,Lucius Malfoy,Come and find out!
Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,"Really, Potter. You expect to defeat all of us with your little school friends? Now hand it over, and they won't have to die here."
Bellatrix Lestrange,Lucius Malfoy,I haven't escaped from Azkaban for this!
Lucius Malfoy,Bellatrix Lestrange,No! If the prophesy is smashed--
Bellatrix Lestrange,Death eaters,Take the youngest girl. We'll see how committed Potter is as we torture her.
Harry Potter,Bellatrix Lestrange,You even try to take her and I'll smash this thing. 
Harry Potter,Bellatrix Lestrange,"So, what kind of prophesy are we talking about here?"
Bellatrix Lestrange,Harry Potter,"Surely you jest, Potter?"
Harry Potter,Lucius Malfoy,Not really. How come Voldemort wants it?
Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,You dare to speak the Dark Lord's name?
Harry Potter,Lucius Malfoy,"Who, Voldemort? Oh, yeah, I dare. Voldemort, Voldemort, Voldemort- - "
Bellatrix Lestrange,Harry Potter,Silence! How dare you utter that name from your half—-blood mouth!
Harry Potter,Bellatrix Lestrange,"Hey, did you know Voldemort's a half-blood too?"
Lucius Malfoy,Bellatrix Lestrange,"Control yourself, Bellatrix!"
Harry Potter,Bellatrix Lestrange,What's so special about this
Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,You mean Dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden here?
Harry Potter,Lucius Malfoy,What?
Harry Potter,Everybody,"When I give the signal, blast the shelves…"
Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,So that's what took you so long. We wondered. 
Harry Potter,Lucius Malfoy,But why did he need me to take it?
Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,"Only a person for whom the prophesy was made can remove it from its self, Potter, and the Dark Lord certainly couldn't get it himself."
Harry Potter,Lucius Malfoy,"So he used me to do his dirty work, did he? "
Harry Potter,Everybody,Now!
Harry Potter,Everybody,RUN!
Hermione Granger,Everybody,Stupify!
Lucius Malfoy,Everybody,Stop them!
Hermione Granger,Everybody,Colloportus!
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Where'd the rest go?
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Harry, they went the wrong way!"
Death Eater,Bellatrix Lestrange,They might have gone on to the hall.
Bellatrix Lestrange,Death Eater,Check under the desks.
Harry Potter,Everybody,Stupify!
Bellatrix Lestrange,Everybody,Avada-—
Neville Longbottom,Everybody,Expelliarmus!
Harry Potter,Everybody,Stupify! 
Harry Potter,Everybody,Ron!
Death Eater,"Harry Potter, Hermione Granger",Impedimenta! 
Death Eater,Hermione Granger,We've got him!
Hermione Granger,Death Eater,Silenco! Stupify!
Harry Potter,Death Eater,Pretificus Totalus!
Neville Longbottom,Hermione Granger,Stupify!
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Hermione!
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger," Please don't be dead, please don't be dead... "
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,"Hermione, wake up…"
Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,What's they do to her? 
Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,"She's alive, Harry. There's a pulse."
Harry Potter,Neville Longbottom,Can we carry her?
Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,I'll do it. You're better at fighting. 
Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,Where do we go?
Harry Potter,Neville Longbottom,I don't know... 
Harry Potter,Ginny Weasley,What happened.
Ginny Weasley,Harry Potter,I think my ankle's broken. And somebody hit Ron with a weird spell...
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Hiyya, Harry."
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,You look funny….
Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,They hit her with something too.
Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,"We need to get out of here. Luna, can you help Ginny?"
Bellatrix Lestrange,Everybody,There they are!
Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,"Your race is run, Potter. Hand it over."
Harry Potter,Lucius Malfoy,Let my friends go and I will.
Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,You are not in a position to negotiate.
Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,"Don't do it, Harry! Don't!"
Harry Potter,Neville Longbottom,"Stop, Neville!"
Bellatrix Lestrange,Neville Longbottom,Neville? Neville Longbottom? 
Bellatrix Lestrange,Neville Longbottom,"My dear boy, I paid your parents a visit a long time ago. We had such a time!"
Neville Longbottom,Bellatrix Lestrange,You put them in St. Mungos!
Bellatrix Lestrange,Harry Potter,"So, Potter. Give us the Prophesy or I'll see how long it takes to crack Longbottom like his parents."
Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,Don't give it to them!
Bellatrix Lestrange,Neville Longbottom,Crucio!
Harry Potter,Neville Longbottom,Are you all right?
Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,Yeah...
Death Eater,Harry Potter,Give me the prophesy!
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"Get out of here, you two!"
Sirius Black,Harry Potter, That will take you back out of the Department of Mysteries.
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,You come with us!
Sirius Black,Harry Potter,"You're the important one, now, Harry. I have to help the Order."
Sirius Black,Harry Potter," I'll always be here for you, Harry. Now go!"
Sirius Black,Bellatrix Lestrange," Hello, cousin!"
Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,Potter! 
Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,"We may have lost the prophesy, but I can still deliver you to the Dark Lord! "
Lucius Malfoy,Harry Potter,Stupify!
Harry Potter,Lucius Malfoy,Protego!
Neville Longbottom,Harry Potter,It's Dumbledore!
Sirius Black,Bellatrix Lestrange,"Is that the best you've got, cousin?"
Harry Potter,Sirius Black,Sirius!
Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,Let me go!
Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,Harry! HARRY!...he's gone...there's nothing you can do...
Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,LIAR!
Harry Potter,Remus Lupin,No...no...no....
Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Harry, no!"
Bellatrix Lestrange,Harry Potter,"You can't stop me, Potter!"
Harry Potter,Bellatrix Lestrange,I'LL KILL you!! 
Harry Potter,Bellatrix Lestrange,Stupify!
Bellatrix Lestrange,Harry Potter,"Come out, come out, Potter... "
Bellatrix Lestrange,Harry Potter,"Well, well, have you come to avenge your dear Godfather?"
Harry Potter,Bellatrix Lestrange,Crucio!
Bellatrix Lestrange,Harry Potter,Crucio! 
Bellatrix Lestrange,Harry Potter,"Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, Potter? You have to mean it, you have to want to cause the pain in your very soul... "
Bellatrix Lestrange,Harry Potter,Give me the prophesy!
Harry Potter,Bellatrix Lestrange,Can't. It got smashed by accident!
Bellatrix Lestrange,Harry Potter,You lie!
Harry Potter,Bellatrix Lestrange,"How's Voldemort going to like that? You've failed him, and he's not very forgiving, is he?"
Bellatrix Lestrange,Voldemort,"Forgive me, Master! I tried, I--"
Harry Potter,Bellatrix Lestrange,"He can't hear you from here, you know!"
Voldemort,Harry Potter,"Can't I, Potter?"
Voldemort,Harry Potter,"So, you smashed my prophesy... "
Voldemort,Harry Potter,"I grow tired of you continually thwarting my plans, Harry Potter! "
Voldemort,Harry Potter,Avada Kadavra!
Albus Dumbledore,Voldemort,"You should not have come here tonight, Tom."
Voldemort,Albus Dumbledore,"It is you who made that mistake, Dumbledore! "
Voldemort,Albus Dumbledore,Avada Kedavra! 
Voldemort,Albus Dumbledore,"You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?"
Albus Dumbledore,Voldemort,"There are other ways to destroy a man, Tom."
Voldemort,Albus Dumbledore,There is nothing worse than death!
Albus Dumbledore,Voldemort,"You are quite wrong, Tom, as you have always been."
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Look out!
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore, Professor!
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Stay where you are, Harry! "
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Kill me now, Dumbledore… do it, if death means nothing..."
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Harry!
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter," Are you all right, Harry?"
Percy Weasley,Cornelius Fudge,"Minister, I saw him! You-Know-Who! He was right there!"
Cornelius Fudge,Percy Weasley,I know...I saw him too...
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"If you and your men will proceed to the Death Room, you will find several Death Eaters which I and some others have apprehended."
Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,Seize him!
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"Minister, you have just seen You- Know-Who in the flesh only seconds ago! It is time to come to your senses! "
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"If you insist on trying to arrest me, I am perfectly willing demonstrate how useless such an attempt will be."
Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,"Dumbledore, what the blazes happened here?"
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"I will explain everything, Minister. Just as soon as I return Harry to school."
Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,What's he doing here? And what's happened to him?
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"Minister, you will order the removal of Dolores Umbridge from my school. "
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"Also, she will probably need medical attention, having had a violent encounter with some Centaurs earlier this evening."
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,All Educational Decrees will be nullified and you will call off the search on Hagrid so he can return to work. 
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"I will return here later tonight, after I have seen to Harry. It should not take long. "
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,Portus.
Cornelius Fudge,Albus Dumbledore,"Dumbledore, I want some answers!"
Albus Dumbledore,Cornelius Fudge,"The Second War has begun, Minister."
Albus Dumbledore,Portraits,Thank you... 
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Please sit, Harry."
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter," I understand how you feel, Harry--"
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,No you don't!
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"You forget that Sirius was my friend too. You are not the only person on this earth capable of feelings, Harry. "
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"There is no shame in feeling pain, Harry. It is your greatest strength..."
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,You don't have a clue! You can't possibly know!
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,What can't I know? 
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"This pain is part of being human, Harry..."
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Then I don't want to be human!
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,I don't care! I don't care!
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,You do care. You care so much you feel like you will bleed to death because of it.
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Let me out.
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,No.
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,You can't keep me in here!
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"I daresay I can. And if you actually do attack me with that wand, Harry, I'm afraid to say you will regret it. "
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,It is my fault Sirius died tonight.
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"I have kept things from you, harry. Things that I should not have concealed. You had a right to know but I put off telling you."
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Had I told you that voldemort might try to lure you down to the Department of Mysteries you would never have gone there tonight. Sirius would never have gone after you.
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,That fault lies with me. I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me one day.
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Harry, I owe you this explanation, to show you the failings of an old man."
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Our explanation begins with your scar. You already know that it is a connection between you and Voldemort, and that this connect goes both ways."
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"I grew worried that Voldemort would at some point discover this connection, which he did the night Mr.Weasely was attacked."
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,I already know all this.
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Haven't you wondered why I haven't spoken to you, even looked at you, for months?"
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Well, yeah, I did..."
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,I was worried that if Voldemort discovered there was a closer relationship between us than simply between teacher and student he would use you to spy the order another mistake.
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Voldemort showed us both tonight that his aim in possessing you would not be to destroy me, but to destroy you."
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Sirius told me you believed there was a snake inside of you. This was Voldemort attempting to manipulate you. To protect you from this, I had you study Occlumency."
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,But Snape stopped giving me lessons.
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Yes. I thought he could overcome his feelings towards your father, but I was wrong. Some wounds cut too deep to be healed."
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"He barely taught me, though. I always felt more open to it after the lessons. Like he was trying to open me to Voldemort—-"
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"I would trust Severus Snape with my life, Harry. You have never recovered from your mistrust of him in your first year."
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Sirius didn't trust him. Didn't believe he'd really turned to our side...
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Again, some wounds run too deep to be healed, Harry. Severus and Sirius never liked each other at school. This has never changed. "
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"During your Occulumency lessons, Professor Snape discovered that you were dreaming about the door in the Department of Mysteries."
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"I've been dreaming about that all year, before Voldemort discovered the connection."
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Yes. Voldemort has been obsessed with hearing that prophesy since he returned. Because of your scar, what he was obsessed with, you were obsessed with, in the form of dreams. "
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Once he discovered the connection, Voldemort had little difficulty in manipulating you into thinking he had captured Sirius."
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,But I checked Grimmauld Place! Kreacher said--
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Kreacher lied. He wanted you to go to the Department of Mysteries.
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Why?
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Kreacher has been serving two masters for some months now.
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,What? 
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"It appears that when sirius told him to get out, Kreacher thought he meant out of the house. So he went to the black's closest relatives, the malfoys."
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Obviously, they questioned him. Sirius had forbidden him from giving up important secrets. But Sirius had neglected to mention his relationship with you"
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"He told them how you saw him as a mixture of father and brother, and that you would move heaven and earth to save Sirius."
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Voldemort sknew that making you velieve he had Sirius in the Department of Mysteries ould force you there.
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Wait, where was Sirius when I tried to contact him?"
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Ah. Apparently Kreacher had injured Buckbeak to distract him in case you tried to contact Headquarters. 
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Sirius was tending to the wounds when you called.
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,And Hermione said we should be nice to Kreacher!
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"She was quite right, Harry. Kreacher is what wizards have made him. He is to be pitied, not hated."
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Sirius hated him.
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,He didn't hate Kreacher himself. Kreacher was a reminder to Sirius of the home he had always hated.
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Yeah, he really hated that place. And you kept him locked up in there!"
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,I was trying to save his life! 
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,It is time to tell you what I should have five years ago. No doubt you have wondered why it was that I sent you there and not to a wizarding family?
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"I did it for your protection. You were in more danger than anyone realized. Voldemort was defeated, but his servants were everywhere."
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,I also knew that Voldemort would return one day. I played to his weakness. There is an ancient magic which Voldemort has always underestimated.
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter," This magic is what your mother gave you when she died. That protection would only work, however, if you were cared for by a blood relative. Your Aunt, Petunia."
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,She never loved me.
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Perhaps not. But she took you in, however grudgingly. As long as you can call your Aunt's house your home, you are protected. "
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"And now we come to the moment of terrible truth, the moment I have dreaded for fifteen years. The moment when I must lay another burden atop your already straining shoulders. "
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Do you remember your first year here? When you lay in the hospital wing fresh from your confrontation with Voldemort? 
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Do you remember what you asked me that night?
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,I asked you why Voldemort tried to kill me.
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Yes. I decided not to tell you then. After all, eleven was too young for such burdens. The same went for twelve. But I was runningout of excuses by thirteen and fourteen. Do you see the flaw in my plan yet?"
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,I cared about you too much. I became more concerned with your happiness and well-being than with the truth and the lives it could save. That was my greatest mistake. It was exactly what Voldemort expects from us fools who love.
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"But I could not bear to tell you. I have watched you pass through greater trials than any other student in the history of this school, and I could not bear to add another one, the grestest one of all."
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"You have no idea the pain it causes me to tell it to you, even now. But unfortunately, I must."
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"I don't understand, Professor. "
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"The reason Voldemort tried to kill you is because of a prophesy made just before your bith. By attempting to kill you, he believed he was fulfilling the terms of the prophesy. Voldemort's mistake was that he had not heard the entire prophesy."
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"That is the weapon we have been guarding, and which he has been so desperately seeking: the knowledge of how to destroy you."
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Professor, why am I so important to him?"
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"An excellent question, Harry. The answer lies in the prophesy."
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"Sir, it got smashed."
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,That was not the only place the Prophesy is preserved.
Sybill Trelawney,Harry Potter,"""The One with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches....Born to those who have thrise defied him, born as the Seventh Month dies… and the dark lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have a power the dark lord knows not… and either must die at the hand of the other for niether can live while the other survives.... The one with the power to vanquish the dark lord will be born as the seventh Month dies..."""
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"I'm not sure I understand all that, sir... "
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,It means that the only person with a chance of defating Voldemort was born at the end of july to parents who had resisted him three times before.
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,And...it means me?
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Interestingly, there were two boys whom the prophesy could have been referring to. You and Neville Longbottom."
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"So it's not necessarily me, sir? "
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,You forget the next qualification of the prophesy. The dark lord will mark this boy as his equal.
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"In giving you that scar, Voldemort did so. I'm afraid that the prophesy is most certainly referring to you."
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,What if he chose wrong? 
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"He chose the child he believed to be the more dangerous. He chose the ""half-blood"" wizard because he saw some of himself in you"
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,He tried to kill you and instead gave you the power and the future to destroy him.
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,Why didn't he wait? Why attack when we were babies?
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"Voldemort had an informant listening to my meeting with Professor Trelawney. Fortunately he was discovered before he could hear the entire prophesy. Voldemort had to act immediately, he didn't know the rest of the prophesy. All he knew was that he had to destroy the child who would grow to be a threat to his power."
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,But I don't have any special powers.
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,There is a room in the Department of Mysteries which is kept locked at all times. It contains a force so wonderful and yet terrible that it is greater than death itself. It is that power which you have incredible amounts of and of which Voldemort has none.
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,"What is it, sir?"
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"This power drove you to save sirius tonight. It kept Voldemort from possessing you, he cannot bear to touch it."
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"In the end, it was your heart and not your head that saved you."
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"There is only the end of the prophesy which we haven't addressed. It states ""neither can live while the other survives."" "
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,"It is the final burden which I must place on you, Harry."
Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore,One of us has to kill the other...in the end.
Albus Dumbledore,Harry Potter,Yes.
Nearly Headless Nick,Harry Potter,"Hello, Harry."
Harry Potter,Nearly Headless Nick,"Hey, Nick."
Nearly Headless Nick,Harry Potter,"I--Well, Madam Pomfrey asked me to tell you that Hermione and Ron are out of the hospital wing."
Harry Potter,Nearly Headless Nick,Oh. Thanks. 
Harry Potter,Nearly Headless Nick,"Nick, I was wondering about something?"
Nearly Headless Nick,Harry Potter,I've been expecting this...
Harry Potter,Nearly Headless Nick,Expecting what?
Nearly Headless Nick,Harry Potter,A lot of people come to me when they've lost loved ones.
Harry Potter,Nearly Headless Nick,I expect so...
Nearly Headless Nick,Harry Potter,"He's not coming back, Harry."
Nearly Headless Nick,Harry Potter,Few wizards choose the path I have chosen.
Harry Potter,Nearly Headless Nick,Why?
Nearly Headless Nick,Harry Potter,"I am neither here nor there, Harry. Trapped between two worlds. That does not appeal to most."
Nearly Headless Nick,Harry Potter,"I know nothing of the secrets of death, Harry. I was afraid of it. I preferred to survive as a feeble imitation of life than face the vast unknown."
Nearly Headless Nick,Harry Potter,I often wonder if that was a wise decision.
Nearly Headless Nick,Harry Potter,"I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help, Harry. Truly I am."
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,Harry!
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,How are you?
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,"Good as new, mate."
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"How are you doing, Harry?"
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,Better.
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Come on, let's go in to the feast."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,You two go on. I want to be alone for a while.
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,I've got something to tell you. Something important.
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger, But not right now. I'm not ready.
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,"Take your time, Harry. We'll be here when you are."
Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,"Hello, Harry."
Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter, It's the last night and I need to pack. 
Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,"Oh, people take my things and hide them. "
Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,"I don't think they like me much. Some of them call me ""Loony"" Lovegood."
Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,Do you need any help looking?
Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,Oh no. It all turns up in the end. 
Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,Sirius Black. Hermione said he was your Godfather.
Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,Yeah.
Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,Hav you ever… you know…
Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,My mother. I was nine.
Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,I'm sorry.
Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,It's okay. It's not like I'll never see her again.
Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,Isn't it?
Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,Don't tell me you didn't hear them. The voices beyond the Veil? 
Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,"They were just out of sight, that's all. "
Harry Potter,Luna Lovegood,You mean we'll see them again?
Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,Of course. 
Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,"Things always work out, in the end."
Luna Lovegood,Harry Potter,"Anyway, my mum always said the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end. If not always in the way we expect. Think I'll just go have some pudding."
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me.
Hermione Granger,Harry Potter,What's that ?
Harry Potter,Hermione Granger,That even though we've got a fight ahead of us we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have.
Ron Weasley,Harry Potter,Yeah ?
Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Something worth fighting for
